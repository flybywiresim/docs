## Clean Install Steps

### Automatic Clean Install

FBW Installer version 3.0.0 introduced the `Uninstall` feature. To perform an automatic clean install:

- Ensure you have the latest FBW Installer on your machine. 
    - The installer updates itself. If you would like to download our installer again, see the [FlyByWire Installer Section](#flybywire-installer).
- Click on the "Uninstall" button.

!!! tip ""
    This removes the aircraft from your community folder and the extra files in `%appdata` or `%localappdata`.

    Your `Work` folder is retained to save your throttle configuration, FDR files, and any other presets we save. 
    (These are small files and do not need to be deleted to fulfill a "clean install" state.)

### Manual Clean Install

<p style="color:yellow; font-size:18px;">TODO: Add A380X folder name + clean install steps</p>

If you would like to manually perform a clean install you first have to delete the 
`flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` or `a380 folder` folder from your community folder.

We also store additional information related to the aircraft in a separate directory, which is built when you load the aircraft in the simulator. You also need to delete the contents of this folder, but not the folder itself. 

These locations are found below:

- [Microsoft Store Version](#microsoft-store-version)
- [Steam Version](#steam-version)

If the above folders are hidden to you, follow the directions on [Microsoft's support site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).

Once in the correct directory, delete the files show here:

<p style="color:yellow; font-size:18px;">TODO: get proper photo for localstate and not temp</p>

![localstate folder](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838062729398976522/869736690695172156/unknown.png){ width=70% }

!!! info "Work Folder"
    The locations below contain a "work" folder. We store two important things here that you may not want to delete:

    - Your EFB throttle configuration.
    - Our flight data recorder (for debugging purposes, which we may ask you to provide).

    **It is up to you to keep this folder or not.**

#### Microsoft Store Version

The folder can be found here:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\packages\flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo\`

- Type in run into the start menu and press ++enter++
- Type into the box `%localappdata%`
- Press ++"OK"++
