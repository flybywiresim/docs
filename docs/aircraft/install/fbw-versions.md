# Versions and Features

## Version Overview

### Development Version (recommended)

Development will have the latest features that will eventually end up in the next stable release.

In general, this version has the latest fixes and newest features but also a slightly higher risk of containing bugs as features had less time to be used and tested by users.

This version updates often, and occasionally several times a day. We recommend updating this version via our installer before every start of the simulator.

Every addition to the development version is code-reviewed and tested by several people, our QA Team and also interested users. In general, it tends to be very stable and robust.

The latest additions to this version can be seen either in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) or the commits to the master branch of the project: [GitHub Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/commits/master){target=new}

### Stable Version

    **Current Stable Version -** <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/flybywiresim/aircraft.svg?color=2F4E5B&style=flat" />

Stable is our version which contains features that are the most mature and most tested. This should be a reliable version for those users preferring stability over the newest features.

This version will not always be up-to-date, but we work hard at ensuring its compatibility with the current version of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

### Experimental Version

We have discontinued our Experimental Version. Latest features and testing will be on the Development Version of the aircraft.
