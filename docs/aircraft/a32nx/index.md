# FlyByWire A32NX Overview

This section of the FlyByWire Documentation is dedicated to the A32NX add-on itself. It covers the software and more technical aspects of the FlyByWire add-on.

The A32NX Project is a community-driven open-source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible. It started out as an enhancement project to the default A320neo and is now proceeding as an independent add-on project aiming to bring the FlyByWire A32NX up to payware-level systems depth and functionality, all for free.
