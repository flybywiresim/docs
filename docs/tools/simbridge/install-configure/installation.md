### Automatic Clean Install

FBW Installer introduced the `Uninstall` feature. To perform an automatic clean install:

- Ensure you have the latest FBW Installer on your machine. 
    - The installer updates itself. If you would like to download our installer again, see the [FlyByWire Installer Section](#flybywire-installer).
- Click on the "Uninstall" button.


!!! tip ""
    This removes the tool from your community folder and the extra files in `%temp%`.

### Manual Clean Install

If you would like to manually perform a clean install you first have to delete the 
 `flybywire-externaltools-simbridge` folder from your community folder.

We also store additional information related to the tool in a separate directory, which is built when you load the tool. You also need to delete the folder.

These locations are found below:

- `%temp%`

If the above folders are hidden to you, follow the directions on [Microsoft's support site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).

Once in the correct directory, delete the folder shown here:
