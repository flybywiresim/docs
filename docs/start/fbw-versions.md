# FlyByWire A32NX Versions

## Stable Version

**Current Stable Version - v0.6.2**

Stable is our variant which has features which are the most mature and most tested so that it should be a reliable version for the more conservative user preferring stability over newest features.

 This version will not always be up to date but we work hard at ensuring its compatibility with the current version from Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## Development Version (recommended version)

 Development will have the latest features that will end up in the next stable. In general this version has the latest fixes and newest features but also a slightly higher risk of containing bugs as features had less time to be used and tested be users.

This version updates often and sometimes several times a days. We recommend to update this version via our installer before every start of the simulator.

Every addition to the development version is code reviewed and tested by several people and our QA Team and interested users and tends to be very stable and robust.

Latest additions to this version can be seen either in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) or the commits to the master branch of the project: : [Github Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/commits/master)

## Experimental Version

This version is similar to the development version, but contains custom systems.

!!! info ""
    Experimental is currently on **hold**.

!!! warning ""
    **No support will be provided via Discord for Experimental versions.**

## Marketplace Version

This version is similar to Stable but is available via the Microsoft Flight Simulator in-sim marketplace.

!!! warning ""
    **Due to Sim Update 5 platform stability issues that are out of our control, we have withdrawn the A32NX from the MSFS marketplace until further notice.**
