# Support Guide

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is still a rather young flight simulator and many issues still need to be addressed.

The FlyByWire A32NX tries to address many of these issues but is also likely to have issues and bugs now and then.

This guide shall help you how to find issues which are already reported and know, workarounds an solutions and how to get additional support via our various support channels.

These are several sources of information you can check if you experience an issue with the FBW A32NX mod. We will describe each of them in more detail below but start with a list you can check in order when you face an issue:

## Research Known Issues

1. Please try and remove all other mods/liveries from the community folder and perform a clean reinstall of the A32NX with the [FlyByWire Installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer). This will help rule out mod conflicts.

    - **Please really do this as >90% of all issues are related with conflicts between mods and liveries, etc.** Unfortunately Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is very sensible to bad mods.

2. Read the [Reported Issues](support.md) section - most reported issues are already on this list.
3. If you have a github account please also see [Issues](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/issues) there. Please use the search for your particular issue.

## Report Issue on Discord
