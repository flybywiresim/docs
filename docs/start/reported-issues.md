* AP not following the flight plan (leaking input values affect, but doesn't disconnect the AP)
    - Workaround: Set dead-zones for your input device higher
        - Go to your settings
        - Controls and select your yoke/joystick/controller.
            - After that click the sensitivity button on the top left which should take you to the menu where you can adjust your deadzones. Start with 20% deadzone, if the problem persists keep increasing it. If it's fine with 20% you can then slowly decrease it too.
