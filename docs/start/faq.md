**Q: Can I download the aircraft in the current state?**

- A: Yes, see [Downloads](/start/installation/#downloads).

??? info "Q: Where is the plane in-sim?"
    The mod will appear as a separate aircraft selector screen, select the `FlyByWire Simulations A320neo (LEAP)` in the aircraft selector instead of the Asobo one.

??? info "Q: How do I install this aircraft?"
    Visit our [Insllation Guide](installation.md).

??? info "Q: What are the liveries available?"
    Liveries made for the default A320neo will no longer function in the new FlyByWire package. Liveries will need to be converted by their respective authors.

    While this might represent an inconvenience for a short amount of time, we are sure that 3rd party content authors will be quick to provide you with updated liveries and programs.

    **Convert Your Liveries:**
    
    - See our guide to [convert liveries](convert-liveries.md)
    - Visit Flightsim.to with updated liveries [here](https://flightsim.to/c/liveries/flybywire-a32nx/)

??? info "Q: Do we have a simBrief profile for fuel?"
    Yes we have one available [here](https://www.simbrief.com/system/dispatch.php?sharefleet=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-)

    You can also use the new simBrief A320-251N profile that is already on their website.

??? info "Q: I cannot hear the Flaps or PTU in the cockpit anymore?"
    This will be the case in the current Development build and future Stable builds. This change was made due to feedback from IRL A320 pilots who identified the sounds could not be heard from the cockpit IRL as they currently are in the simulator. 

    The PTU now has a toggleable switch on the EFB (flyPad) settings that allows you to hear it in the cockpit when it is running.

??? info "Q: What is the Experimental Version?"
    The Experimental Version is the Development build with a custom project added where highly experimental features are tested. These builds are subject to various bugs and errors, which are often changed daily. Users can use this build with the caveat that it is not supported in the #support channel.

    **At the time of writing, there is no currently active Experimental project, Development should be used instead.**


**Q: When will it be released?**

A: The project is an ongoing rolling release. See [Downloads](/start/installation/#downloads).

**Q: When is the next update?**

A: We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each Stable build update via [discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire) and our social media: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FlyByWireSimulations), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlybywireSim).

**Q: How do I join the team?**

A: Head over to [A32NX Development Overview](/a32nx-dev/overview) and join our Discord to get started.

**Q: Is it payware?**

A: No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source.

**Q: How do we report bugs?**

A: Report bugs to us in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/flybywire), under the #help channel, or by creating a GitHub issue. Just make sure to search for existing issues first before creating a new one.

**Q: Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?**

A: We have three versions: Stable , Developer (Master), and Experimental.

* The Stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator.

* The Developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress. Although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time. If you find this to be the case, you can report these issues in [#help](https://discord.com/channels/738864299392630914/785976111875751956) in discord or via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/issues/new/choose) Please check there is not an existing issue of the same nature as yours first.

* The Experimental version contains the custom fly by wire system. This branch is updated whenever the 'fbw' branch on Github is updated, which is around every 12 hours. No support is provided for this version via Discord.
