## Passenger Simulation

!!! important "Cockpit Door"
    The cockpit door in the A32NX is simulating a real A320 cockpit door which in consequence dampens most of the sounds from the passenger cabin. 

    If you want to enjoy the Passenger Ambience sounds make sure it is open. 

We have included various settings that simulate flight crew interactions with passengers on board.

### Passenger Ambience
If this setting is enabled the following ambience sounds are played:

- Boarding sound begins when the W/B in `MCDU-ATSU-AOC-W&B` boarding is started.
- Once passengers are on the plane, a constant passenger ambience background sound plays.
- Deboarding through the W/B section in `MCDU-ATSU-AO-W&B` triggers the deboarding sound.

### Announcements

If this setting is enabled the following crew announcements are played.

## Realism Settings

### PTU

The PTU is generally not heard in the cockpit. As a passenger we understand people may be used to this sound as it is very audible in the passenger cabin.

We have added a toggle to allow the PTU to be heard in the cockpit which in real life is not the case. 

## Engine and Wind

- Exterior Master Volume:
    - Volume for sounds audible when in external views.

- Engine Interiors Sounds:
    - Volume for engine sounds when in interior views.

- Wind Interior Volume:
    - Volume for wind sounds when in interior views.
