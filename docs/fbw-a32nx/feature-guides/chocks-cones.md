Other than just looking gorgeous the wheel chocks even apply some braking force to hold the aircraft in place.

The flight crew activates the Wheel Chocks and Safety Cones in the flyPad EFB. This simulates asking the ground crew to place or remove the chocks or cones. The ground crew will then (virtually) determine if chocks and cones should be placed or removed based on some specific criteria, which are described in the next section.

## Usage

The Wheel Chocks and Safety Cones appear when the following conditions are given:

- Chocks and/or Safety Cones are activated in the [flyPad EFB Ground Page](flyPad/ground.md)
- Engines are off (`ENG1+2 N2` < 1%)
- Beacon lights are off
- Airplane is on ground
- Pushback is disconnected

If chocks are in place there will be brake force is applied to the aircraft so it should not move even when the parking brake is disengaged.

If any of the above conditions is not given the checks and cones will disappear (ground crew will virtually have them removed).
