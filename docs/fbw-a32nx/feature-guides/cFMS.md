- [x] Multiple leg types:
    - [x] TF: Track to a Fix defines a great circle track over ground between two known databases fixes.
    - [x] RF: Constant Radius Arc defines a constant radius turn between two database fixes, lines tangent to the arc and a center fix.
    - [x] VM: Heading to a manual termination defines a specified heading until a Manual termination.
- [x] LNAV turn prediction
- [x] Roll anticipation distance
- [x] Correct procedure and direct-to sequencing
- [x] Improved flight plan rendering / drawing
- [x] Improved ND display filters for  ARPT, VOR, NDB, WPTs
- [x] FIX INFO for radials and distance circles on navigation fixes - [Guide Here](fixinfo.md)

## Known Issues

- DIRECT-TO: Turning point is not correctly implemented yet.
- Defining both FROM/TO in the world map shows in the FROM/TO INIT A page but does not populate the airport list in our METAR (AOC) integration.
- ETA in F-PLN A on the MCDU may not be 100% accurate.
- Flight plan frozen on loading in (Please post the specific route on which this occurs and under what circumstances, i.e. spawning in c&d using the MSFS flight planner, or simbrief, or loading in .PLN generated by simbrief or other external program).
- Fuel calculations might be incorrect.
- In-sim default ATC and VFR map is not 100% supported. - [See Feature Guide](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-plan-sync).
- No traffic shown, TCAS elements are cosmetic only.
- Only 3 Leg Types/1 Transition supported at this time.
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of legs will be glitched or incorrect if you are flying faster than the appropriate/correct speed. - [See Feature Guide](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-path-rendering).
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of terminal procedure legs may be glitched or incorrect during cruise. - [See Feature Guide](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-path-rendering).
- Route on VFR map will not match up with what is shown on the ND.
- WX and TERR on ND INOP.

## Special Notes

### Flight Plan Sync

Our custom FMS provides better accuracy and features over the default offering in MSFS which results in issues syncing the flight plan from the MCDU back into the simulator.

As noted above *your mileage may vary* but we have provided a feature on the EFB that helps sync the flight plan so MSFS ATC can read it. On routes with significant differences from your flight plan in our FMS (See ND plan mode), don't expect it to go too well.

### Flight Path Rendering

In certain instances some legs may not render correctly with our current implementation and may look strange in PLAN mode or while enroute. In most cases the A32NX will attempt to fly the route and you won't experience any major issues.

Additionally, some flight plans may have extraneous waypoints that can lead to wrongly drawn flight paths. While this is can be an edge case, going through your flight plan in `PLAN` mode you can find offending waypoints that need to be removed what will provide a much more reasonable drawn flight path.
