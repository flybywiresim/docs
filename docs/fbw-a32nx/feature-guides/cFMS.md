## Known Issues

These issues are specific to the custom FMS.

- Approach phase must be manually activated (no DECEL point).
- In-sim default ATC and VFR map is not 100% supported. Mileage will vary. On routes with significant differences from your flight plan in our FMS (See ND plan mode), don't expect it to go too well.
- Route on VFR map will not match up with what is shown on the ND.
- Only 3 Leg Types/1 Transition supported at this time.
- WX and TERR on ND INOP.
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of terminal procedure legs may be glitched or incorrect during cruise.
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of legs will be glitched or incorrect if you are flying faster than the appropriate/correct speed.
- ETA in F-PLN A on the MCDU may not be 100% accurate.
- Fuel calculations might be incorrect.
- No traffic shown, TCAS elements are cosmetic only.
- Defining both from/to in the world map do show in the from/to init page but do not populate the airport list in METAR (AOC).
- Flight plan frozen on loading in (Please post the specific route on which this occurs and under what circumstances, i.e. spawning in c&d using the MSFS flight planner, or simbrief, or loading in .PLN generated by simbrief or other external program).
- DIRECT-TO: Turning point is not correctly implemented yet.
