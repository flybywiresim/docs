## Features

### Version 1

- [x] Custom flight plan management replacing the default Asobo flight plan manager (FPM).
- [x] SID/STAR/APPR waypoints can now be edited.
- [x] No more USR waypoints from the Asobo FPM.
- [x] Correct procedure and direct-to sequencing.
- [x] Added Discontinuities as in the real life aircraft. See [Guides and Information](#guides-and-information) below.
- [x] Support for multiple leg types:
    - [x] TF: Track to a Fix defines a great circle track over ground between two known databases fixes.
    - [x] RF: Constant Radius Arc defines a constant radius turn between two database fixes, lines tangent to the arc and a center fix.
    - [x] VM: Heading to a manual termination defines a specified heading until a Manual termination.
- [x] Cross-track error indicator on the ND.
- [x] Improved LNAV turn prediction.
- [x] Roll anticipation distance.
- [x] Improved flight plan rendering / drawing.
- [x] Improved ND display filters for ARPT, VOR, NDB, WPTs.
- [x] MCDU FIX INFO page for radials and distance circles on navigation fixes. See [Guides and Information](#guides-and-information) below.

## Known Issues

- TCAS is not implemented yet. No traffic shown, TCAS elements are cosmetic only.
- WX and TERR on ND are not implemented yet. We are waiting for better API support by Microsoft Flight Simulator. See our [Forums Feature Request](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/implement-weather-and-terrain-api-s-for-aircraft-developers-to-implement-accurate-radar-predictive-windshear-egpws-and-metar-wind-uplink/442016){target=new}.
- Only 3 Leg Types/1 Transition supported at this time. Although these cover most of the important types there might be some issues with other leg types during flight guidance. We will be significantly improving this in future updates.
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of terminal procedure legs may be glitched or incorrect during cruise. - [See Special Notes](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-path-rendering).
- Rendering of flight path on the ND of legs will be glitched or incorrect if you are flying faster than the appropriate/correct speed. - [See Special Notes](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-path-rendering).
- Syncing the aircraft flight plan with the sim's flight plan for default ATC and VFR map is not 100% supported. - [See Special Notes](../feature-guides/cFMS.md#flight-plan-sync-and-msfs-atc).
- Defining both FROM/TO in the world map shows in the FROM/TO INIT A page but does not populate the airport list in our METAR (AOC) integration.
- DIRECT-TO: Turning point is not correctly implemented yet.
- ETA in F-PLN A on the MCDU may not be 100% accurate.
- Flight plan frozen on loading in (Please post the specific route on which this occurs and under what circumstances, i.e. spawning in c&d using the MSFS flight planner, or simBrief, or loading in .PLN generated by simBrief or other external program).
- Fuel calculations might be incorrect.
- Route on VFR map will not match up with what is shown on the ND.

## Special Notes

### Flight Plan Sync and MSFS ATC

Our custom FMS provides better accuracy and features over the default offering in MSFS which results in issues syncing the flight plan from the MCDU back into the simulator. On routes with significant differences from your flight plan in our FMS (See ND plan mode), don't expect it to go too well.

As noted above *your mileage may vary* but we have provided a feature on the EFB that helps sync the flight plan so MSFS ATC can read it. By default, this feature is set to `None` on the EFB. If you would like to try and use built-in ATC for your flight you need to switch the `Sync MSFS Flight Plan` setting to `Save`. You can find this page in the [EFB Settings - Sim Options](flyPad/settings.md#sim-options).

### Flight Path Rendering

In certain instances some legs may not render correctly with our current implementation and may look strange in PLAN mode or while enroute. In most cases the A32NX will attempt to fly the route and you won't experience any major issues.

Additionally, some flight plans may have extraneous waypoints that can lead to wrongly drawn flight paths. While this is can be an edge case, going through your flight plan in `PLAN` mode you can find offending waypoints that need to be removed which will provide a much more reasonable drawn flight path.
