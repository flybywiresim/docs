# Custom Hydraulics

## Gear system

### Known issues
  - Door visual position is not modeled yet due to 3D model issues. Their actual position is however fully simulated internally.
    Because of this:
    - Gear doors will start to visually open with a 2 to 3s delay, because actual doors are in fact already opening during those 2-3s while you cannot see them
