# MCDU Web Interface

## Overview

The MCDU Web Interface allows you to display and control the MCDU on any browser including mobile devices like phones or tablets.

It also allows to use your real printer on to be used as a cockpit printer for the MCDU.

## Starting the MCDU Web Interface

### Start the MCDU Web Interface Server

To be able to use the MCDU Web Interface you need to start the web server which will provide the application to your browser.

To do this locate the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder in your MSFS Community folder. Within this folder you will find a folder called `MCDU SERVER`. Open this folder.

![MCDU Server Executable](../assets/mcdu-server/mcdr-server.exe.png "MCDU Server Executable"){loading=lazy}

Double click on the `server.exe` file to start the MCDU Server.

!!! tip "You can also you as a command line prompt to start the server."
    See advanced startup options below: [Advanced Start Options](#advanced-start-options)

Once started the MCDU Server application will ask if you want to use your real printer instead of the virtual printer in the cockpit.

If you choose to use your real printer then press ++y++, after which you need to select which printer you want to use. The MCDU Server will list all printers available in your Windows.

If you do not want to use your printer select ++n++.

After this the MCDU Server will start and will provide you with links for your local browser to access the MCDU Web Interface.

**You will need to keep this window open and the MCDU Server running to use the MCDU Web Interface**.

!!! warning "IP Address for Remote Device"
    The IP address shown for the remote device might be incorrect. The tool chooses the first local address it finds put there is a chance that you need to use a different IP address to reach your PC.

    Details see in chapter [Browser on Remote Device](#browser-on-remote-device)

### Browser on Local PC

If you want to use a browser on the same machine on which you are running the Microsoft Flight Simulator and the MCDU Server it is very easy to connect to the MCDU Web Interface.

Just use ++ctrl+left-button++ on the `localhost` link in the command window and it should open the MCDU Web Interface in your default browser.

[http://localhost:8125](http://localhost:8125){target=new}

If you want to start with only the MCDU display and not the whole MCDU panel then add "/fullscreen" to the url.

[http://localhost:8125/fullscreen](http://localhost:8125/fullscreen){target=new}

### Browser on Remote Device

If you want to use the MCDU Web Interface from a remote device (e.g. tablet, phone, 2nd PC, etc.) you need to first make sure you can access the MCDU Web Interface on your PC by allowing incoming network connections to the server through your Windows Firewall. See how to do this here: [Windows Firewall](#windows-firewall)

The MCDU Server command window tries to guess your IP address. Use the `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8125` address and enter it into your browser on the remote device.

??? note "Incorrect IP Address (click to expand)"
    Sometimes a wrong IP address will be shown in the MCDU Server command window and it will not be possible to connect to the MCDU Server from a remote device.

    To find your correct IP address follow this guide: [How to Find Your IP Address on Windows 11](https://www.howtogeek.com/744082/how-to-find-your-ip-address-on-windows-11/){target=new}

    The port is set to 8125 per default and can be changed be command line options (see [Advanced Start Options](#advanced-start-options)) .

    Enter the correct IP address and port into the remote device's browser address line and hit enter.

    Example: http://192.168.16.1:8125

If you want to start with only the MCDU display without the MCDU panel then add "/fullscreen" to the url.

## How to Use the MCDU Web Interface

The MCDU Web Interface can then be used by mouse or touch on touch enabled devices.

It is also possible to click on the MCDU screen items themselves to actually click the corresponding LSK (Line Select Key).

Changes done in the MCDU Web Interface will be reflected immediately in the cockpit and vice versa. Any change in the cockpit will be immediately shown in the MCDU Web Interface.

If you want only the MCDU display to be shown then tap on the top-most part of the MCDU display. To return to full MCDU view tap anywhere on the display.

If you want to start with only the MCDU display visible then add "/fullscreen" to the url.

## Using Your Local Printer

If you chose a local printer during the start of the MCDU Server every prints you will make from the MCDU to the cockpit printer will instead by printed using your previously selected printer.

The printers available are those known to the PC where you run Microsoft Flight Simulator and the MCDU Server on. It is not relevant if your remote device where you use the MCDU Web Interface actually knows this printer.


## Advanced Start Options

The MCDU Server application has several additional command line options to control the startup configuration.

```
> server.exe -h

Usage:
server [options]

Options:
--debug              enables debug mode
-h, --help           print command line options
--http-port=...      sets port for http server (default: 8125)
--no-printer         skips prompt to select printer
--printer=...        enables printing to the specified printer
--websocket-port=... sets port for websocket server (default: 8080)
```

- http-port:
    - This is the port you need to add to your URL in the browser to access the MCDU Web Interface.
    - E.g. 8125 for this URL: http://localhost:**==8125==**
- no-printer:
    - To skip the prompt asking to choose a printer and not have a local printer configured. This option is required if you want to start the server without any manual interaction (e.g. starting it with the sim).
- printer:
    - To skip the prompt asking to choose a printer and have a specific local printer configured. This option is required if you want to start the server without any manual interaction (e.g. starting it with the sim).
- websocket-port:
    - The port where the MCDU Web Interface will communicate with the MCDU itself.
    - **This is not the port you need to access the MCDU Web Interface with your browser **.
    - We recommend to **only** change it if absolutely required (e.g. port is already occupied). See [Websocket Port](#websocket-port) for details.

### Websocket Port

The websocket port is the port where the MCDU Web Interface will communicate with the actual MCDU. It sends and receives data through this connection.

This will allow to have different UI implementations or even hardware MCDUs in the future. We plan to eventually also create a separate documentation for using this websocket connection directly.

We recommend to **not** change the default port for the websocket. If you have to change this port because it is already occupied on your machine you need to change it as well in the EFB Sim Options Settings page.

## Windows Firewall

!!! danger "Disclaimer"
    Changing Windows settings, especially security settings like the firewall comes with certain risks. Please do not change these settings if you are not comfortable doing so. FlyByWire Simulations cannot take any responsibility for any issues caused by your changes to Windows or security settings.
