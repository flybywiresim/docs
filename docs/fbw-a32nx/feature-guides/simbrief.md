# SimBrief Integration

## Flight Planning

Flying IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) even in a simulation like Microsoft Flight Simulator always requires some level of flight planning.

In addition to the obvious route planning there are several other aspects which are critical to any good flight plan:

- Route Planning
    - Origin and Destination
    - Runways, SID and STAR
    - Compliance with ATC Requirements
    - Routing and Constraints
- Fuel Calculation
- Weather Forecast
- Cost and Time Optimization

See [Flight Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_planning){target=new} on Wikipedia for more information.

Microsoft Flight Simulator tries to offer a simple way to do route planning (World Map before starting a flight) however this falls short, especially for users wanting a more realistic experience for airliner flying.

In real life airlines and pilots use dedicated software alongside various sources and services for creating their flight plans.

In the world of flight simulation simBrief does all that for the users based on real word databases and sources. SimBrief provides on average ~40.000 flight plans to users each day and is the most commonly used tool for flight planning for non-professional flight simulation.

It is absolutely possible to use the simBrief OFP (Operational Flight Plan) to configure and program the aircraft based on it without any special integration into the flight sim software or aircraft.

But as in real world aircraft it is common in flight simulation aircraft to integrate these systems directly with the aircraft's flight management system to be able to import all the relevant planning data. This includes the route, altitudes, constraints, fuel, payload (passengers, cargo), and other data points.

This is why FlyByWire has implemented our simBrief integration and will continue to improve this experience even further in the future.

## Using the FMS (MCDU) and simBrief Integration

### Importing the simBrief OFP to the FMS (MCDU)

We've included a quick method to have your simBrief OFP automatically loaded into the MCDU. Please do not select an arrival airport on the MSFS world menu otherwise the integration will not work.

This portion of the guide assumes that you understand how to generate a simBrief OFP.

<!--#### ^^SimBrief MCDU Setup^^

Enter your simBrief username. Upon entering your username the MCDU will convert it into an ID number. Please ensure you have no special characters in your username OR use the ID number found before generating your OFP.

* Click on `MCDU MENU`
* Click on `OPTIONS`
* Click on `AOC`
* Click on `SIMBRIEF`-->

#### ^^Request Data from simBrief^^

* Return to `MCDU MENU`
* Click on `ATSU`
* Click on `AOC MENU`
* Click on `INIT/PRESS`
* Click on `INIT DATA REQ`

![MCDU ATSU AOC INIT REQ](../../fbw-a32nx/assets/feature-guides/simbrief/mcdu2.png "MCDU ATSU AOC INIT REQ"){loading=lazy}

This will prepare the MCDU to input the flight plan.

#### ^^Initialize Flight Plan^^

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"
    Do not select an arrival airport on the MSFS world menu or flight planner. Doing this "initializes" the `FROM/TO` field when loading into your flight removing the INIT REQ. option from the `INIT A` page. 

Head over to the `INIT A` page.

* Select `INIT REQUEST` by pressing LSK2R

This will load your flight plan from simBrief directly into the MCDU

![MCDU INIT A](../../fbw-a32nx/assets/feature-guides/simbrief/mcdu1b.png "MCDU INIT A"){loading=lazy}

To learn how to set up the MCDU you can read the [**^^F^^**LIGHT PLAN](../../pilots-corner/beginner-guide/preparing-mcdu.md#flight-plan) section in our beginner's guide.

### Loading Fuel and Weight

!!! info "Customizing Fuel and Weight"

    **NOTE:** There may be slight differences when using our Stable version vs. Development verson. Additionally these settings may be moved to our EFB in the future.    

    You can adjust the amount of fuel and weight manually on these pages. Type in your desired amounts and press the relevant LSK to input it into that field. 

    When you are happy with your changes press `LOAD` using LSK5L to load your custom fuel and weight.

    !!! danger "Please do not touch values in MSFS Fuel & Weights window in the toolbar."

As described in the previous section return to the AOC menu in MCDU menu.

* Click on `MCDU MENU`
* Click on `ATSU`
* Click on `AOC MENU`
* Click on `PERF/W&B`

#### ^^Fuel^^

!!! info "flyPad Fuel Loading"
    You may also perform fuel loading via our EFB which has a great UI to see the status of fuel tanks and other options. [Guide Here](flyPad/dispatch.md#fuel-page)

![MCDU ATSU AOC PERF/W&B](../../fbw-a32nx/assets/feature-guides/simbrief/mcdu3.png "MCDU ATSU AOC PERF/W&B"){loading=lazy}

You are presented with the `Fuel Page` first then the `Weights and Balance` page. On the first page you can automatically load your fuel.

* Press LSK5L to instantly load your planned simBrief fuel. (The load button will flash momentarily).
* You can verify fuel has loaded by looking at your upper ECAM FOB.

Using the horizontal slew keys you can switch to the weights and balance page.

#### ^^Weights and Balance^^

<style>
.md-typeset details {
    display: flow-root;
    overflow: visible;
    padding-top: 0;
    font-size: 0.8rem;
}
.md-typeset .admonition-title, .md-typeset summary {
    background-color: rgba(68,138,255,.1);
    border-left: .2rem solid #448aff;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 0.7rem;
    margin: 0 -.6rem 0 -.8rem;
    padding: .4rem .6rem .4rem 2rem;
    position: relative;
}
</style>

In our development version we have introduced a new flight model paired with a new weight and balance payload method that incorporates seat rows and the correct center of gravity. Please use the correct instructions for your corresponding installed version.

??? info "Development"
    !!! block ""
        ![W&B 2](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb2.png){align=right width=50% loading=lazy}

        Once on `W&B` page (2/2) it should look like the sample image even if you have pressed OFP REQUEST in a previous section.

    !!! block ""
        ![W&B 3](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb3.png){align=right width=50% loading=lazy}

        You will have to request OFP again for this specific page and your `W&B` page will show total passengers and passengers per row awaiting boarding.

    You can now start boarding by selecting LSK6L (the indication will change from `START` to `STOP` in yellow) and watch as the passengers board the aircraft. 

    ==**You do not need to remain on this page as boarding continues.**==

    ![W&B 4](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb4.png){width=45%} ![W&B 5](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb5.png){width=45% loading=lazy}

    Once boarding has completed all rows and total pax should turn green and the boarding indication returns to `START`. Verify your ZFW on this screen and check your lower ECAM that GW has been updated. 

    ![W&B 6](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb6.png){width=90% loading=lazy}

    #### ^^Deboard Passengers^^

    !!! block ""
        ![deboarding](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/deboarding.png){align=right width=50% loading=lazy}

        Once you have completed your flight you can opt to deboard passengers from the aircraft. Return to the AOC MENU and head to page 2 of `W&B`. 

        Type in 0 into the scratch pad so your page looks like the image.

    !!! block ""    
        ![deboarding 2](../assets/feature-guides/simbrief/deboarding2.png){align=right width=50% loading=lazy}

        Select `LSK1L` to input the 0 passenger value into the TOTAL PAX field on this page. Your page should now look like the sample to the right.

        Simply press START to begin the deboard process.

??? info "Stable"
    Once on the `W&B` page (2/2) you can adjust payload here or accept the numbers provided to you via your simBrief OFP.

    - Press LSK5L to instantly load your planned payload and pax.
    - You can verify the weight has changed by looking at the lower ECAM towards the lower right-hand side.
