## General

???+ info "Q: Where is the plane in-sim?"
    The add-on will appear as a separate aircraft, select the `FlyByWire Simulations A320neo (LEAP)` in the aircraft selector instead of the Asobo one.

??? info "Q: Can I download the aircraft in the current state?"
    Yes, see [Downloads](../installation.md#downloads).

??? info "Q: How do I install this aircraft?"
    Visit our [Installation Guide](../installation.md).

??? info "Q: What are the liveries available?"
    Liveries made for the default A320neo will no longer function in the new FlyByWire package. Liveries will need to be converted by their respective authors.

    While this might represent an inconvenience for a short amount of time, we are sure that 3rd party content authors will be quick to provide you with updated liveries and programs.

    **Convert Your Liveries:**

    - See our guide to [liveries](../liveries.md)
    - Visit Flightsim.to with updated liveries [here](https://flightsim.to/c/liveries/flybywire-a32nx/){target=new}

??? info "Q: Do we have a simBrief profile for fuel?"
    Yes we have one available [here](https://www.simbrief.com/system/dispatch.php?sharefleet=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-){target=new}

    You can also use the new simBrief A320-251N profile that is already on their website.

??? info "Q: When will it be released?"
    The project is an ongoing rolling release. See [Downloads](../installation.md#downloads).

??? info "Q: When is the next update?"
    We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each Stable build update via [Discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire){target=new} and our social media: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FlyByWireSimulations){target=new}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlybywireSim){target=new}.

??? info "Q: How do I join the team?"
    Head over to [A32NX Development Overview](../../dev-corner/dev-guide/index.md) and join our Discord to get started.

??? info "Q: Is it payware?"
    No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source.

??? info "Q: How do we report bugs?"
    Report bugs to us in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/flybywire){target=new}, under the `#support` channel, or by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/issues/new/choose){target=new}.

    Just make sure to search for existing issues first before creating a new one.

??? info "Q: Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?"
    We have three versions: Stable , Development, and Experimental.

    **Stable**

    Stable is our variant that has the least bugs and best performance. It will not always be up to date but we guarantee it's compatibility with each major patch from MSFS. See [Downloads](/start/installation/#downloads).

    **Development**

    Development will have the latest features that will end up in the next stable. Bugs are to be expected. It updates whenever something is added to the 'master' branch on Github. See [Downloads](/start/installation/#downloads).

??? info "Q: What is the Experimental Version?"
    The Experimental Version is the Development build with a custom project added where highly experimental features are tested. These builds are subject to various bugs and errors, which are often changed daily. Users can use this build with the caveat that it is not supported in the `#support` channel.

## Aircraft

???+ info "Q: I cannot hear the Flaps or PTU in the cockpit anymore?"
    This will be the case in the current Development build and future Stable builds. This change was made due to feedback from IRL A320 pilots who identified the sounds could not be heard from the cockpit IRL as they currently are in the simulator.

    The PTU now has a toggleable switch on the EFB (flyPad) settings that allows you to hear it in the cockpit when it is running.

??? info "Q: Which lights should I turn on during taxi/takeoff/flight?"
    There are many fantastic tutorials online which demonstrate the proper use of lighting on the A320noe, take a look at this video from 320 Sim Pilot:

    [Airbus Lights: What you didn't (need to) know! With a Real Airbus Pilot in Flight Simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9XUHepoFDg){target=new}

??? info "Q: Is the hold function implemented yet?"
    No - The buttons are on the MCDU however it is not functioning at the moment.

??? info "Q: Why is the overall interior lighting different? (Blue light effect on pedestal and displays)"
    Based on IRL A320 pilot feedback, the blue light effect can only be seen from images. Also, the pedestal should be dark at night to improve pilots' vision at night.

??? info "Q: Why does light bleed into the cockpit? Can this be fixed?"
    Unfortunately no - This is a deeper issue which will require work from the Asobo team.

??? info "Q: The new sounds are different than the default ones, why?"
    The default sounds were shared sounds from other default aircraft. The new sounds are accurate and very well developed based on the A320 and A320neo pilot feedback.
