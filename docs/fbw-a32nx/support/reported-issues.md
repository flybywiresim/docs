??? failure "Invisible Aircraft"
    ### Invisible Aircraft

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description and Symptoms^^

    If you have the following issues you are **most likely on an outdated stable** or you have an **installation conflict**:

    - White EFB screen
    - PFD is missing bank angle protection indicators
    - `NOT IN DATABASE` MCDU error
    - External lights are not working
    - Invisible Aircraft

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Double install of the add-on and conflict with very old, unsupported versions.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Go to your content manager and filter for "flybywire" as you see on the following image.

    ![version sample](../assets/version-sample.jpg){loading=lazy}

    If you see old versions (e.g. v0.6.1) or if you have multiple installations of the A32NX please uninstall them in the Content Manager and restart the sim. Reinstall development version from our [installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer){target=new}.

??? failure "Bad Performance after Sim Update 7 and Using DX12"
    ### Poor Performance After Sim Update 7 and Using DX12

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development, Experimental*

    ^^Description^^

    Using DX12 introduced in Sim Update 7 seems to not work well with our aircraft.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Investigation ongoing.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Use of DX11 is recommended for best performance due to an issue with some
    glass cockpit technologies in the DX12 version of the simulator. This is
    not an FBW issue and we cannot address it for now - please keep in mind
    DX12 is officially a "beta feature" and thus should not be used unless
    you know what you are doing.

??? warning "Ailerons Not Working When Using the Keyboard"
    ### Ailerons Not Working When Using the Keyboard

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable*

        **Note:** This is reported on our [Autopilot / Fly-By-Wire Page](../feature-guides/autopilot-fbw.md) and duplicated here for visibility.

    ^^Description^^

    The aircraft's ailerons can't be controlled with keyboard or button inputs. Therefore the aircraft can't be rolled for left or right turns.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    There is currently an issue with the associated events. We highly recommend using a controller with an axis assigned to use the plane.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    - Use the latest Development version where we have introduced a workaround for this issue. ( [#6222](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/pull/6222) )

??? warning "Fuel Consumption Too High / Fuel Prediction Too low"
    ### Fuel Consumption

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Fuel consumption may be higher than estimated in the MCDU (Fuel Pred, F-PLN).

    ^^Root Cause^^

    *A fix is in the works.*

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Take more fuel especially for longer flights.

    ^^Additional Information^^

    We are working on more realistic simulation of various involved systems, e.g. engines. The fuel estimations and consumptions will be inaccurate until we have completed these systems.

??? warning "Autopilot: Unwanted Disconnection"

    ### Autopilot Disconnection While Interacting with the EFB

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    When using the EFB Descent TOD calculator, MSFS control assignments on your keyboard may still be accepted. Therefore, when using the numpad for input into EFB, you may inadvertently be applying flight control events.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    We have identified that the Descent TOD page still accepts outside events.

    *Currently under investigation.*

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    1. Unbind any flight control assignments for your numpad or number keys on the keybaord through the MSFS settings.
    - Slightly moving the axis of the rudder and/or sidestick (or pressing 5 on the numpad) after entering data into the EFB. This will center the rudder or alierons to prevent a consistent deflection of flight surfaces.

    ### Autopilot Disconnection Due to Excessive Speed Decay

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Excessive speed decay during level off from open descent can lead to unwanted autothrust disconnection or even alpha floor in certain high drag/low speed situations.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Currently under investigation.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    N/A

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Initialization timing issue of MSFS.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Workaround: Restart the flight

??? warning "Outer Tank Fuel Transfer"
    ### Outer Tank Fuel Transfer

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Sometimes the sim will "*miss*" the trigger point being reached for outer tank fuel transfer to initialize.
    This may happen if the sim is "busy" when working with something else OR initial FOB at the start of flight is below the trigger point.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Intermittent Issue / Under Investigation

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^
    Add enough fuel to get past the trigger point of 239 gallons before departing.

??? warning "EFB Issues in External View"
    ### EFB Issues in External View

    !!! tip ""
       *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

??? warning "Liveries Converted from the Default Asobo A320 Cause Issues"
    ### Liveries Converted from the Default Asobo A320 Cause Issues

    ^^Description^^

    Old liveries or liveries intended for the default Asobo A320 cause issues like artifacts, systems not working, CTDs, etc.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Old liveries or converted Asobo A320 liveries are often not compatible with the latest sim versions or the FlyByWire A32NX.

    !!! warning ""
        Also do not convert liveries from the default Asobo A320 any more. Although out Installer still provides this option we do not recommend this any more as these liveries often cause issues.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Use current liveries intended for the FlyByWire A32NX from flightsim.to.

    See [Liveries Guide](../liveries.md)

    ^^Additional Information^^

??? tip "++ctrl+'E'++ -  Engine Start Unsupported"
    ### ++ctrl+'E'++ -  Engine Start Unsupported

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    The auto start shortcut via ++ctrl+'E'++ will not work.

    Currently you need at least the APU Avail and APU Bleeds to be switched on, as well as the fuel pumps to be on for a normal engine start. (Crossbleed starts will be implemented at a later time).

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Our custom systems and realistic simulation of onboard systems requires the proper engine start procedure for the A320neo.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    We highly suggest learning how to start the engines manually by reading our beginner guide. [Beginner Guide - Engine Start Section](../../pilots-corner/beginner-guide/engine-start-taxi.md#engine-start).

??? tip "Cockpit Interaction System"
    ### Cockpit Interaction System

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Switches, knobs and dials can't be used with simple mouse clicks as before.

    Controls appear highlighted in color (mostly blue) when the mouse hohvers over them.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Asobo

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    We recommend the legacy (previous) method of the Cockpit Interaction System:

    - Go to Menu
    - General Options
    - Accessibility
    - Find the `Cockpit Interaction System` setting
    - Change to `legacy`

    ^^Additional Information^^

    Using **New** Cockpit Interaction System

    - Highlight a control (like a knob).
    - Hold ++"Left Click"++ to lock to that control. Now your mouse will not affect any other controls or other mouse bindings.
    - Move the mouse left to turn the knob left, move it right to turn the knob right (with the ++"Left Click"++ held down)
    - You can also use the scroll wheel while holding ++"Left Click"++ down to turn the knob left or right.
    - To push a control / knob in, lock to the control using ++"Left Click"++ and then ++"Right Click"++.
    - To pull a control / knob out, hold ++"Left Click"++ and then click your scroll wheel ++"Middle Mouse"++.
        - Note: If you already use the ++"Middle Mouse"++ button to activate freelook this may not work. Check your keybinds so this feature does not conflict.

??? failure "CTD (Crash to Desktop)"
    ### CTD (Crash to Desktop)

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    With the current state of the sim it is basically impossible to analyze CTDs let alone fix them as MSFS does not provide any tools or logs for analyzing CTDs.

    If we can reliably reproduce a CTD in our aircraft we will try to fix it or at least work around it. But most CTDs are very unpredictable and can be caused by many things:

    - Add-ons and mods
        - Liveries<br/>(flightsim.to just removed 1000s of them because of that)
        - Airports
        - Basically any add-on and mod that may be outdated or have conflicting files
    - MSFS itself (e.g. Rolling Cache is often a cause)
    - Hardware (GFX Card and Driver, Overclocking, etc.)
    - Controllers and Drivers

    Unfortunately just using the sim's API functions might trigger a CTD, so the trigger could be the aircraft but the root cause would be the sim.

    If you can reproduce it reliably please share this information with us on Discord or our GitHub so we can try to also reproduce it. This would be the first step to fix anything.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Various possible reasons - impossible to determine at the moment.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    There also is currently no known guaranteed solution, however users have found success with by trying the following:

    1. [Perform a clean install](../installation.md#clean-install-steps)
    2. Try without anything else installed in community.
    3. Try without FSUIPC OR update FSUIPC.
    4. Try downloading the bat file that is pinned in the #support channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire). Run it to clean up any FBW background files.
    5. Run without live weather and/or live traffic.
    6. Delete your rolling cache in the sim and create a new one.
    7. Delete any manual cache in the sim and create new ones.
    8. Run the game as Administrator.
    9.

    !!! info "Peripherals"
        This is an important snippet from MSFS known issues.

        If you are getting CTDs, it could be one of your peripherals disconnecting sometime during the flight, which then causes the sim to CTD.

        It could be anything from a usb drive to a controller. Please try to minimise how many peripherals you have connected.

        *Affected versions: Stable*

    ^^Description^^

    There are certain bugs with the default FMS - the FlyByWire team is working on a custom FMS which will fix and address all these bugs and adds much better lateral navigation.

    1. Autopilot tries to go Direct to RWY when activating approach.
    - Autopilot tries to return to a previous waypoint when activating approach.
    - Selecting a STAR and arrival runway in the MCDU while in flight will result in the issues above.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Asobo default Flight Planning System causes this.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    - Use DIRECT to head to the correct waypoint on your F-PLN or use selected heading. This should allow you to continue with your selected STAR for arrival.
    - You can also try switching to selected heading BEFORE selecting your STAR and arrival runway to prevent unwanted flight plan redirection.
        - Ensure your next waypoint is correct on the ND before returning to managed HDG/NAV mode on the FCU.
    - If you can, always enter your expected approach in the MCDU before departing. If this doesn't need to be changed, this will skip the turnaround bug on approach. This issue and others like it will be resolved in cFMS.

    ^^Additional Information^^

    The Asobo default flight planning system will be completely replaced by the upcoming FlyByWire Custom Flight Management System.

??? warning "Navigation Data Issues"
    ### Navigation Data Issues

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Missing navigation data:
    - Waypoints, VOR, NDB, etc.
    - SIDs, STAR, APPR
    - Airports

    ^^Root Cause^^

    MSFS' Navigation Data issue - missing data or corrupt data.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    If you use Navigraph:

    - Install/uninstall Navigraph data with the Navigraph Navdata Center application.
    - __Do not__ delete `navigraph-navdata` from the community packages directory, as this will leave default navdata disabled.

    If not using Navigraph:

    - MSFS navigation data is not complete and some issues are to be expected especially when using 3rd party planning tools like SimBrief.
    - No workaround available but often the issue can be ignored and still have a successful flight.

    ^^Additional Information^^

    You can test these issue by using the MSFS World Map. If the required nav data (waypoint, SID, STAR, APPR, RwY, Airport, etc.) is missing in the World Map as well, then it is a general nav data issue and not an issue with the aircraft.

    Also see this post on the MSFS forum: [Navigraph airac cycle 2112-load MSFS Database is empty](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/navigraph-airac-cycle-2112-load-msfs-database-is-empty-no-vors-sids-or-stars/479371){target=new}

??? warning "MSFS Anit-Ice vs. De-Ice Functionality"
    ### MSFS Anit-Ice vs. De-Ice Functionality

    ^^Description^^

    Icing occurs (windshield, engines, wings) although Anti-Ice is turned on.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    There is actually no anti-ice capability in MSFS and Asobo currently has no plans to add it in the near future.

    The anti-ice systems therefore work as deice systems (after the fact) rather than anti-ice systems (preventive).

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    No workaround but flights should not be impacted too much by this.

    ^^Additional Information^^

     Consequence of this MSFS behaviour is that the auto probe/windshield heat will not always prevent ice from forming on the windshield or the pitot probe. Although the ice should melt fairly quickly (and no need to switch from auto to on), the windshield can still freeze over and you can lose airspeed information upon first entering icing conditions if they are severe enough.

    The same goes for wing and engine anti-ice - turning them on before ice actually forms may not prevent ice from forming there, but it should melt fairly quickly.

??? warning "Rudder Keybindings Not Working"
    ### Rudder Keybindings Not Working

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    Rudder control with keyboard not possible.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    Wrong key bindings.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    You have to set your keybinding to rudder axis right and left

??? warning "Altitude Issues"
    ### Altitude Issues

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    The effects of non-standard day pressure and temperature on altitude in MSFS were inaccurate during *Sim Update 5*.

    This is reported to be fixed by Asobo in current patch - **World Update 6**.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    MSFS issue.

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Climb or descend a couple hundred feet at a time until the in game ATC stops requesting you to climb or descend.

    ^^Additional Information^^

    VATSIM

    VATSIM controllers may also see you at a different altitude when you are below the transition altitude. We recommend including a note on your flight plan that you are using MSFS. VATSIM software is being modified to remedy this.

??? warning "MSFS Live Weather"
    ### MSFS Live Weather

    !!! tip ""
        *Affected versions: Stable, Development*

    ^^Description^^

    If the live weather feature is experiencing issues you may experience the following:

    - Degraded aircraft performance.
    - Airspeed and climb rate issues.

    You will typically see higher or excessive fuel flow alongside exceedingly high SAT, which leads to high TAT and ISA deviation.

    !!! info ""
        ISA deviation is the difference between SAT and the ISA temperature for that altitude and is indicated by the value next to ISA in the ECAM.

    ^^Root Cause^^

    MSFS Issue

    ^^Possible Solution or Workaround^^

    Use a static weather preset for your flight.
