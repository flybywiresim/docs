### 2. Confirm Calibration

Check that the mappings are correct. If you push the pedals forwards ("toe brakes"), the Joystick L-Axis X and Joystick L-Axis Y indicators should move from top right (0% brakes applied) to bottom left (100% brakes applied).

If the Joystick L-Axis X/Y indicators only move from the center of the graphs to the left bottom, you will need to calibrate your pedals.

## Controller Specific Settings

### Thrustmaster Pedals

??? note "Thrustmaster Drivers"

You do not need to install the Unified Drivers Package - 2018.FFD.2 as these drivers will make the reset/calibration dialog unavailable.

#### Reset and Calibration

1. From the Windows Start menu or the Control Panel, search for **`Set up USB game controllers`**.
2. Your game controllers should be displayed. Select your pedals (i.e. **`T-Rudder`**) from the list. Click the **`Properties`** button. ![USB Controller Settings](assets/rudder/GameControllersThrustmaster.jpg "USB Controller Settings"){loading=lazy}
3. From the **`Settings`** tab, click on **`Reset to default`**.
4. Click on the **`Test`** tab to confirm the settings. The cursor should be displayed in the bottom right corner (0% brakes applied) or top left corner (100% brakes applied), while the Z-Axis indicator should be at 50% if the rudder is centered. ![Calibrated Settings](assets/rudder/GameControllersRudderSettings.jpg "Calibrated Settings"){loading=lazy}
