# Common Hardware Controllers and Setup

This page shows you a collection of common flight simulation hardware which can be used together with Microsoft Flight Simulator and the FlyByWire A32NX.

To make these controllers fully compatible you need to replace their default drivers with the appropriate software. See [here](index.md#solutions).

The examples below are configured via SPAD.neXt and the configuration documentation is linked below.

With SPAD.neXt you can also download complete profiles for aircraft and hardware controllers. For the FlyByWire A32NX and the controllers below this profile is used (which is downloadable from within SPAD.neXt):

Find the complete SPAD documentation for these controllers in this single file: [A32NX FBW MSFS2020.pdf](../assets/api-guide/A32NX%20FBW%20MSFS2020.pdf){target=new}

This profile is maintained by Cdr_Maverick#6475.

To build your own profile you can use our Flight-Deck API Documentation: [Flight-Deck API](../../pilots-corner/a32nx-briefing/a32nx_api.md)

These flight sticks have normal flight surface controls (pitch, roll and yaw) but they also have 10 configurable buttons, 8-way hat switch and a slider.

We recommend using the Microsoft Flight Simulator normal mapping for the flight surfaces.

The rest of the buttons can be mapped as you require it.
