# Versions and Features

## Version Overview

=== "Development Version (recommended)"

    Development will have the latest features that will eventually end up in the next stable release. 
    
    In general this version has the latest fixes and newest features but also a slightly higher risk of containing bugs as features had less time to be used and tested by users.

    This version updates often and sometimes several times a days. We recommend to update this version via our installer before every start of the simulator.

    Every addition to the development version is code-reviewed and tested by several people, our QA Team and also interested users. In general it tends to be very stable and robust.

    Latest additions to this version can be seen either in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) or the commits to the master branch of the project: : [Github Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/commits/master){target=new}

=== "Stable Version"

    !!! info ""
        **Current Stable Version - v0.6.3**

    Stable is our version which has features that are the most mature and most tested so that it should be a reliable version for the more conservative user preferring stability over newest features.

    This version will not always be up to date but we work hard at ensuring its compatibility with the current version from Microsoft Flight Simulator.

=== "Experimental Version"

    This version is similar to the development version, but contains custom systems in earlier development phases.
    
    Currently the new FlyByWire Custom Flight Management System (cFMS) is available in the Experimental version.
    
    The experimental version will be updated with the latest changes to the cFMS regularly and also with the latest changes to the Development version. Expect updates about once a week (not guaranteed).     
    
    !!! warning 

    Please read [Experimental Version Support Page](support/exp.md) before using this version.

    !!! danger "No Support for Experimental - use at own risk"
        Please do not seek support for the Experimental Version on Discord and only report issues if you have read this page and the reported and known issues. You can report issues in the Discord channel "#ata-22-fms" in the thread "[CFMS LNAV ONLY Bugs + Issues](https://discord.com/channels/738864299392630914/876140343735771147/882442909918584862){ target=new }".

=== "Marketplace Version"

    This version is similar to Stable but is available via the Microsoft Flight Simulator in-sim marketplace.

    !!! warning ""
        **Due to Sim Update 5 platform stability issues that are out of our control, we have withdrawn the A32NX from the MSFS marketplace until further notice.**
