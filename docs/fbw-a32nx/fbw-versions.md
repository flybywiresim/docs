# Versions and Features

## Version Overview

### "Development Version (recommended)"

Development will have the latest features that will eventually end up in the next stable release.

In general this version has the latest fixes and newest features but also a slightly higher risk of containing bugs as features had less time to be used and tested by users.

This version updates often and sometimes several times a days. We recommend to update this version via our installer before every start of the simulator.

Every addition to the development version is code-reviewed and tested by several people, our QA Team and also interested users. In general it tends to be very stable and robust.

Latest additions to this version can be seen either in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) or the commits to the master branch of the project: [Github Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/commits/master){target=new}

### "Stable Version"

!!! info ""
    **Current Stable Version -** <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/flybywiresim/a32nx.svg?color=2F4E5B&style=flat" />

Stable is our version which has features that are the most mature and most tested. This should be a reliable version for those users preferring stability over newest features.

This version will not always be up to date but we work hard at ensuring its compatibility with the current version from Microsoft Flight Simulator.

### "Experimental Version"

This version is similar to the development version, but contains custom systems in earlier development phases.

We use this version to find problems, issues and to improve functionality based on your feedback. It is not meant to be used for daily use or when you try to do a serious flight on VATSIM.

!!! warning

The Experimental version has a less strict QA process and is used for actual QA testing. Bugs and Issues are to be expected. 

!!! danger ""
    Before using this version please read [Experimental Version Support Page](support/exp.md) to see what is currently being tested. 

The experimental version will be updated regularly and also with the latest changes to the Development version. Expect updates about once a week (not guaranteed).

!!! danger "Do not expect support for the experimental version - use at own risk!"

We ask that you understand that we may not offer support for any experimental issues due to the nature of this version. We will happily answer questions time permitting.
