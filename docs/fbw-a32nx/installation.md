    The folder in the Community directory is now:

      - `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo`

    The airplane in the simulator is now titled:

      - `FlyByWire Simulations - A320neo (LEAP)`

!!! info "Marketplace Version Incompatibility"
    The A32NX on the MSFS  marketplace is incompatible with any of our installer / standalone versions.

    You must **choose** one of the options below:

    - The marketplace version installed
    - One of the branches from our installer/website.  

    If you're an existing user and want to benefit from our regular updates, you should stay on the version you fly already or download using the options below to keep the plane up to date:
