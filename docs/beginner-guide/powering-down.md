# Powering Down

This guide will explain the correct procedures to power down the aircraft when at the gate after arriving at the destination and taxi to the designated gate.

Obviously this is not strictly required in a simulator but for interested sim pilots this might be an interesting process for a more realistic experience.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    The level of detail in this guide is meant to help a FlyByWire A320neo
    beginner to correctly shut down the aircraft.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft 
    or different types of airliners. Aviation terminology and know-how is 
    a requirement to fly any airliner even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
