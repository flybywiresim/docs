## MSFS start from gate or runways

Microsoft Flight Simulator allows you to start your flight from cold & dark
at a gate or directly from the runway with the aircraft ready for takeoff.

For this guide we assume you started cold & dark at the gate and taxied to
the runway holding point.

If you did start on the runway you can skip the first part (Line-up) and
directly continue reading Takeoff.

## Pre-requisites

- Aircraft is in taxi state (checklist TAXI completed)
- ATC has instructed to hold at runway holding point
- Aircraft is at runway holding point, parking breaks are set
