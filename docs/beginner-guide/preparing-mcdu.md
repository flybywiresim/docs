# Preparing the MCDU

This guide will help you prepare the MCDU in the A32NX for your departure. It includes a simple route so you can follow along easily and replicate in the simulator.

***

## Pre-requisites 

Before programming the MCDU there are a few pre-requisites that are required. These steps should have been completed in the previous step - [Starting the Aircraft](#). 

* Make sure the aircraft is powered up.
    * External Power OR APU
* Make sure the ADIRS are set to NAV. 
* Have a valid flight plan.

## Understanding the MCDU

During the course of this guide we will be referring to a few key terms that which are defined below. 

=== "Left Select Key (LSK)"

    `LSK` for short. These are on the left hand side of the MCDU screen. They are highlighted in the image below and are referenced in descending order. Top being `LSK1` and the lowest key `LSK6`

=== "Right Select Key (RSK)"

    `RSK` for short. Much like `LSK`, these are on the right hand side of the MCDU screen. They are highlighted in the image below and are referenced in descending order. Top being `RSK1` and the lowest key `RSK6`

=== "Scroll Keys"

    These keys are referenced below.

    !!! info

        === "Left and Right"

            These keys allow you to scroll between certain page i.e. `INIT A` and `INIT B` when the INIT page is selected. 

        === "Up and Down"

            These keys allow to scroll vertically on certain pages i.e. `F-PLN` page.

## MCDU Programming 

**D.I.F.F.S.R.I.P.P**

Pilots commonly use the acronym above when programming the MCDU. It represents the following:

`DATA - INIT A - FLIGHT PLAN - FUEL PRED - SECONDARY FLIGHT PLAN - RADNAV - INIT B - PROG - PERF`

For simplicity's sake this portion of the guide will be split into three sections.

* Section 1 - [DATA - INIT A - FLIGHT PLAN](#section-1)

* Section 2 - [FUEL PRED - SECONDARY FLIGHT PLAN - RADNAV](#section-2)

* Section 3 - [INIT B - PROG - PERF](#section-3)
