# After landing and taxi to gate

This guide will explain the correct procedures after we have landed and vacated the runway and then taxiing to the designated gate.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
