## Description

The ice protection system allows unrestricted operation of the aircraft in icing conditions.

ANTI-ICING

Either hot air or electrical heating protects critical areas of the aircraft as follows.

HOT AIR

- three outboard leading-edge slats of each wing.
- engine air intakes.

ELECTRICAL HEATING

- flight compartment windows.
- sensors, pitot probes and static ports.
- waste-water drain mast.

## Usage

### WING ANTI ICE

This switch controls the wing anti ice system on the left and right sides simultaneously.

- ON: It lights up blue.
    WING A. ICE appears on the ECAM MEMO page.<br/>
    Wing anti ice control valves open if a pneumatic supply is available.<br/>
    On the ground the wing anti-icing control valves open for 30 seconds only (test sequence).<br/>
- OFF: ON light goes off. Wing anti-icing control valves close.
- FAULT: Amber light comes on, and caution appears on ECAM, if:
    - the position of the anti-icing control valve is not the required position, or
    - low pressure is detected.<br/>
    Note : The amber FAULT light comes on briefly as the valves transit.

### ENG 1 + 2

- ON: light comes on blue.<br/>
    ECAM MEMO displays "ENG A. ICE".<br/>
    Engine anti-ice valve opens if bleed air is available from the engine.<br/>
    Continuous ignition is selected when the valve is opened and the ANTI ICE ENG pushbutton switch is selected ON. This makes the IGNITION memo appear on the ECAM.
- OFF: ON light goes out. Engine anti-ice valve closes.
- FAULT: Amber light comes on, and caution message appears on ECAM, if the position of the anti-icing valve disagrees with the ENG 1 (2) pushbutton selection.<br/>
   Note : The amber FAULT light comes on briefly as valve transits.

###  PROBE/WINDOW HEAT

- AUTO: Probes/Windows are heated automatically:
    - in flight or
    - on the ground (except TAT probes) provided one engine is running.
- ON: Probes and windows are heated permanently. Blue light comes on.
