## Description

Emergency Locator Transmitters are mounted towards the aft in the airplane, and designed to be triggered upon impact or may be manually activated using the remote switch and control panel indicator in the cockpit.

Activation of the ELT triggers an audio alert, and 406-MHz ELTs transmit GPS position for search and rescue.
