The Overhead Aft Panel contains the Emergency Circuit Breaker Panel.

Circuit breakers (C/Bs) are constantly monitored and the tripping of a C/B will be clearly indicated, either through:

-	Activation of a system warning
- 	A failure test
-	An abnormal instrument configuration

or, for C / Bs monitored by the ECAM system:

- Six zones have been defined
- Each time a C / B trips, the corresponding zone is 	identified
