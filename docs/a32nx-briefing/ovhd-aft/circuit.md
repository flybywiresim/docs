## Description

The Overhead Aft Panel contains the Emergency Circuit Breaker Panel.

The aircraft has two types of C/Bs :

- Monitored (green) : When out for more than one minute, the C/B TRIPPED warning is triggered on the ECAM.
- Non-monitored (black).

The C/B TRIPPED warning on the ECAM indicates the location of the affected C/B. The following panels are monitored : OVHD PNL, L(R) ELEC BAY, REAR PNL J-M or N-R or S-V or W-Z.

Note : The C/B TRIPPED, caution may be cleared from the ECAM by pressing the CLR or the EMER CANCEL pushbutton. If the EMER CANCEL is used, and if a second C/B is tripped on the same panel, the corresponding C/B TRIPPED caution will not be triggered.
