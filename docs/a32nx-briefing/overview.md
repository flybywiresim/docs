# A320neo Systems Briefing

**For Simulation Use Only**

This A320 System s Briefing shall give a good overview of most A320neo
systems for personal flight simulation with focus on Microsoft Flight
Simulator and the FlyByWire A320neo aircraft mod.

Other variations of the A320 (A318, A319, A321) have a lot of overlap
but are omitted in this briefing.

This is a work in progress and we will add more chapters over time.
