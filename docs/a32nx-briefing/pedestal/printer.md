## Description

The printer prints reports from the following systems (if installed) : ACARS, AIDS, FMGC, CFDIU and EVMU. It prints these on paper, and does so either on the ground or in flight.

It has a SLEW switch which is used to feed paper after having loaded a new roll.

The printer panel can be opened by the printer door latch which locks the door used for loading paper.
