!!! tip "Recommended Settings"
    Before your first flight, please make sure to read our [Recommended Settings](../fbw-a32nx/settings.md) guide.

    **SimBrief Integration**

    We have streamlined the the authentication process with Navigraph services (SimBrief included). Please note any changes on the following page:

    [SimBrief Integration](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/simbrief.md){.md-button}

    **Navigraph Airframe**

    The team at Navigraph have been kind enough to include our airframe as a selectable option on SimBrief. You no longer have to save our custom airframe to your account to 
    use it. If we decide to make any changes, it will be automatically updated in their system.

## Feature Details

### VNAV

We are thrilled to introduce the foundational layer of the vertical navigation capabilities (VNAV) in the A32NX. This release incorporates the rudimentary vertical prediction and 
guidance functions, laying the groundwork for advance functionalities in future updates.

Simulation pilots scan accept the following in the current version:

- Precision in speed, altitude, time, and fuel predictions through all flight phases as showcased in the MCDU.
- Display of vertical predictions on the navigation screen including the top of descent, vertical path, target altitude, target speed, and relevant [Navigation Display symbology](#).
- Vertical guidance in managed modes providing vertical path and speed guidance. 
- Capability to set cruise steps directly in the MCDU.
- Set cruise steps directly in the MCDU. 

!!! note "Development Pipeline"
    We wanted to provide a short note that this first iteration release into the stable version does not include certain features that are still currently in development.

### flyPadOS Version 3.2 

Our latest flyPadOS brings forward server key enhancements and fixes that pilots can now enjoy.

!!! tip ""
    **EFB/ATSU Improvements** 

    We've not incorporated the reliable NOAA ([aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/)) as a METAR source, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date weather data. Additionally, our system will now utilize MSFS METAR data, moving away from the older FSX cloud data original provided through the FBW API. This will ensure a more synchronized weather experience in your flight deck.

### SimBridge

### Cross Bleed Engine Starts

Pilots are now able to initiate an engine start from crossbleed air. This procedure is normal performed when the APU Bleed start is not possible. For more information visit our 
dedicated [Crossbleed Engine Start](#) page.

We have further expanded our suite of sensor simulation in the aircraft to support this feature.

!!! tip "" 
    **Engine and Crossbleed Updates**

    - Initiate engine start from crossbleed air.
    - Fully open/fully closed sensors for the crossbleed valve.
    - Crossbleed valve indications for open, closed, and in-transfer status.

!!! tip "" 
    **Sensor Implementations**
    - Pressure sensors for regulated, transfer, and precooler inlet pressures.
    - Precooler outlet temperature sensor.

!!! tip "" 
    **SD Bleed Page Enhancements**
    - Updated SD Bleed page indications.
    - Adjusted precooler inlet pressure's green/amber logic.
    - 5-second confirmation before displaying a closed indication for the pressure regulating valve.

!!! tip ""
    **BMC and ECAM Updates**
    
    - Bleed air overpressure, underpressure, and overheat detection in the BMC. 
 
!!! note ""
    ECAM warnings to be added in future updates

**Valve and Regulation Improvements**
- Enhanced fan air valve regulation logic.
- Overpressure valve implemented. 
- Reworked high-pressure valve regulation.

**Physics and Efficiency Updates**
- Reworked engine compressor physics. 
- Increased precooler cooling efficiency. 
- Tuned APU bleed pressure.

**Fault Light Logic**
- Reworked pack fault light logic for better accuracy.

### Air Conditioning Simulation + Failures

This release introduces a realistically simulated intricate model of the Air Conditioning System tailored specifically to emulate an A320 equipped with an ACSC (Air 
Conditioning System Controller). Key additions include:

- ARINC Discrete Communication: To ensure high-fidelity data transfer and system controls.
- Valve Simulation and Dynamics: Detailed simulation of the TAPRV (Trim Air Pressure Regulating Valve) and TAV (Trim Air Valves) have been introduced. Along with this, users will observe a more realistic temperature response time from the pack, further enhancing the immersion until packs are fully modeled.
- System Failures: A crucial aspect of any simulation is the unpredictability and the challenges it presents. Pilots can now set failures in various compontents. See our 
  [Custom Air Conditioning](#) page for more information.
  - Additional Failures Introduced: For those seeking an added layer of challenge and immersion, we've implemented scenarios like trim air system high-pressure malfunctions and duct overheats.
