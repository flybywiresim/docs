# Stable Release v0.7.5

This release provides compatibility with the update for SU9 - `1.25.7.0`. We've also included a few minor fixes to 
various features.

!!! warning "NOTICE"
    **This release does not contain our new custom FMS version 1 (cFMS v1).**

    Please use this version 0.7.5 if you wish to stay on the default FMS. We **strongly** recommend using
    Development and the new FMS unless the v0.7.0 base for third-party compatibility is needed.
