[Intro Text Here]

This release now includes these major features:

- [x] Brand EFB with flyPadOS 3 with expanded feature set and quality of life updates
- [x] Major improvements to the FMGC resulting in better leg and navigation management
- [x] Fully realistic hydraulics simulation across all aspects of the A32NX
- [x] Improved visuals and elements in the PFD, SD, and MCDU
- [x] FBW's SimBridge external features 

For a full release changelog - [see here](#changelog)

!!! tip "Recommended Settings"
    Before your first flight please make sure to read our [Recommended Settings](../fbw-a32nx/settings.md) guide.

!!! warning "Important User Experience Changes"

    Please note the following changes:

    - [SimBridge](../simbridge/index.md) is now required to use the MCDU Remote Display and the new Local Files feature.    
    - Custom Flight Management System
        - See the [Special Notes Section](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS.md#special-notes) on our custom FMS page for details on the topics below:
            - Weather and Terrain are now inoperable as we wait for Asobo implementations.
            - MSFS Built-in ATC and VFR maps are on limited support.
    - [Discontinuities](../pilots-corner/advanced-guides/flight-planning/disco.md) may now appear in your flight plan â€” they are a feature and not a bug.
    - [Throttle calibration](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/flypados3/throttle-calibration.md) is mandatory.
