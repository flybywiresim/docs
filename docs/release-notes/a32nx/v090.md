## Realistic F/CTL Computers

Various EFCS computers have been implemented in the A32NX to facilitate realistic data acquisition from the correct sources (ADIRS, RAs, SFCCs, LGCIUs etc.) and compute their 
logics and laws from this data. Additionally, they will realistically communicate with each other via busses and discrete data.

In this first version we have also included the laws used within the computers themselves selected accurately via the built-in logic. It also performs other functions such as 
monitoring of the peripherals,(ADIRS, RA etc), and computation of miscellaneous logic, for example Aileron Droop, Ground spoiler and speedbrake functions.

The main takeaway of note is having the F/CTL computers now in the A32NX will allow for accurate representation of various system logic on aircraft displays and realistic 
communication between these systems.

## Onboard Systems

### FMGC Updates

Further tweaks and refinements have been implemented. We have fixed various issues related to holds, turn 
directions for course / path capture transitions, and navdata loading and path planning. We've also improved the navdata
performance when loading various procedures. Alongside these fixes we have implemented PI legs (procedure turns).
 
One of the more nuanced additions is support for RNP at or below 0.3 NM. This means the A32NX is capable to 
calculate its position with a radius of 3 tenths of a NM in a circle with its navigational system.

We've also reworked the departure pages to ensure it handles `tmpy` correctly. NO SID is displayed correctly and 
there is a distinction between no selection made yet, no selection available (NONE) and no SID/TRANS selected. ILS 
information is available for runways alongisde magnetic bearings. A fix has also been implemented to ensure transition 
pagination is correct. 

A couple of new features added is preliminary wind request support and CO RTE (available through SimBridge).

- Wind request is available via WIND/TEMP on INIT A to request wind data via AOC if you have a SimBrief OFP generated. 
This can pull the relevant wind data provided by SimBrief. You are always welcome to enter this data manually. While 
this is a simplified implementation for now, it is a nice quality of life for our sim-pilots utilizing SimBrief.

    [More Info Available Here](../../pilots-corner/a32nx/a32nx-briefing/mcdu/f-pln.md#wind-page){.md-button target=new}

- CO RTE support through [SimBridge](../../tools/simbridge/index.md) allows you to locally store company 
routes on your PC. You can now type in the name of your company route into the CO RTE field or select one after 
typing in a FROM/TO pair. 

    [Guide Available Here](../../tools/simbridge/simbridge-feature-guides/coroute.md){.md-button target=new}

### Multipurpose Display and Control Unit

We have added both functional and visual updates to the MCDU. Functionally we have corrected the scrolling behavior on the arrivals/departure now true to life, added imperial runway lengths and implemented the Wind Request feature if you
have generated an OFP on simBrief. Formatting across various pages have been improved and corrected to more accurately represent the version of software we are modelling on the MCDU.

While we continue to work on other aspects this release further solidifies many of the realistic and accurate MCDU features we released in Stable Version 0.8.0.

### PFD

Barberpole indicators on the PFD are now more performance friendly and include a neat little visual effect when going too fast or too slow - the bar will stop moving with the speed scale.

The yellow GS reference line will also always be displayed if pitch and role are valid (even when the LS Pb is not active). In an effort for simulation convenience we have also created a setting on the EFB
to allow users to sync the FD/LS buttons between the CPT and FO.

## flyPadOS 3

![flypadOS3](../assets/flypad-hero.png)

Our latest operating system for the onboard Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) has been completely revamped with a refreshing new user experience and plenty of integrated convenience 
features for loading fuel and weight, accessing charts and local files, aircraft presets, and many more. Additionally, a first in flight simulation the EFB now supports over 30 
different languages!

We previously wrote an extensive NOTAM on our website detailing all the new features that shipped with flyPadOS 3. Please click the button below to read more!

[NOTAM: flyPadOS 3](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/flypados3/){.md-button target=new}

As we have continued to make improvements since that NOTAM was published the two most notable inclusions to date would be our new method of loading fuel and passengers onto the aircraft. You now have a great animated user interface to see passengers filling seats with a high degree of customization for both seat and weight allocation complete with dynamic CG and payload chart.

See [Fuel and Weight Guide](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/loading-fuel-weight.md).

![WB Example Image](../../aircraft/a32nx/assets/feature-guides/simbrief/wb_location.png){loading=lazy}

Another notable inclusion would be our new Local Files feature shipped with SimBridge. You can see an example of this in the [SimBridge](#simbridge) section further below. This allows you to store a variety of PDFs and images for use during your flight. Get access to your own personal charts without requiring a 3rd party subscription! 

See [Local Files Guide](../../aircraft/common/flypados3/charts.md#local-files).

## Hydraulics Simulation

All actuators of the plane are fully physically modeled, and will react to solenoid valve command signals. Good news is that all of those signals are simulated realistically by the new flight computers implementation. This means the entire flight controls and hydraulic system now forms a cohesive set, able to simulate the behaviours of the real plane, including complex failure modes.

The whole gear system is physically simulated including a fully functional gravity extension backup. It will react to aero forces and accelerations accurately, and can also have failures.
Small details in the hydraulic simulation are now included, such as fluid movement inside the reservoirs and negative G feeding: you can't always trust the gauges!

Hydraulics have now reached what can be considered a high fidelity level, and we believe this is the most accurate to date.

## Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC)

Our previous releases that feature our fully custom electrical system has allowed us to begin connecting systems properly with improved functionality
and better integration for true to life simulation which would further support failure scenarios.

The ACSC is now connected to our electrical system providing differing levels of functionality depending on what systems are powered to drive the primary and secondary computers of the ACSC.

### Scenarios with Electrical Issues

If electrical systems are shut off or in an inoperable state where the primary computer is not available, you can note that temperature cannot be changed from 24 degrees and flow is set to 100% / NORM. Additionally, if both computers are not
functioning each zone is "fed" directly by the packs resulting in zero temperature control and the pack flow valve controller no longer operable due to lack of power.

!!! warning "ECAM warnings are not yet implemented"

## CPDLC and ATSU

CPDLC enjoys a more rounded out implementation encompassing plenty of new features and improvements to those that were shipped with our previous Stable release.

If you would like to learn how to utilize CPDLC with Hoppie ACARS and see the entire feature set please see the page below!

[Hoppie ACARS](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/hoppie.md){.md-button}

!!! info ""
    You are now able to use the following additional features:

    - [x] Automatic position reports
    - [x] Controller report-requests and automatic preparation of pilot replies
    - [x] Controller to pilot: All Instructions including requests, confirmations, etc.
    - [x] Datalink status
    - [x] Flight Monitoring for conditional reports
    - [x] Pilot requests: All kinds, incl. emergency
    - [x] Simulation of FANS-A+ and FANS-B with automatic mode selection based on logon-code of ATC

We also released a [NOTAM: ATSU VDL3 Simulation](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/vdl3/){target=new} describing in detail how our new datalink works.

## SimBridge

We have released our custom-built application SimBridge, which enables our users to connect various external devices and data for use with MSFS. 

SimBridge is launched through the FBW Installer and runs silently in your taskbar during your flight. This Stable release includes a new feature that allows users to utilize local files on your PC in PNG or PDF format. 

![localfiles1](../assets/localfiles1.png){loading=lazy}
![localfiles2](../assets/localfiles2.png){loading=lazy}

Additionally, we have transitioned both the MCDU Remote Display and printing function to utilize SimBridge. Configurable settings are now easier to modify through the FBW Installer user interface.

To learn more about the various features implemented with SimBridge, guides on usage and configuration, and troubleshooting see our SimBridge section.
