# Stable Release v0.8.1

This release includes various bugfixes and a notable change to how our *disable AI assists* feature works. See the warning below!

For our VR users we have added the missing PilotVR default camera entry to work around an MSFS issue. You can read more about the issue - [here](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/bug-fs2020-using-3d-cockpit-camera-in-vr-wrong-horizontal-plane-rotation-ex-fbw-a320-salty-747-asobo-787-sdk-sample/428618?u=cptlucky8){target=new}.

!!! danger "MSFS AI Assistance"
    Due to 3rd party mods that bypass the method we have implemented to disable AI assists we have decided to no longer force the assistance functions. This would cause issues 
    if we update our flight model and these 3rd party mods are installed.

    {--

    Having any AI features or assistance features switched on created some stability issues with our custom systems:

    - A/THR failing to arm or activate.
    - Engines turning off in-flight or after takeoff.
    - Constant right or left rudder.
    - Inability to taxi.
