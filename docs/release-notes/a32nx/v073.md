# Stable Release v0.7.3

Our latest release provides compatibility with Sim Update 7 along with a fix for printer CTDs.

!!! warning "NOTICE" 
    **This is the last stable release before the merging of our custom FMS version 1 (cFMS v1).** 

    Please use this version if you wish to stay on the default FMS. We however *strongly* recommend using Development and the new FMS unless you need the v0.7.0 base for third-party compatibility.
