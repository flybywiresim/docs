### flyPadOS Version 3.2 

Our latest flyPadOS brings forward several key enhancements and fixes that pilots can enjoy.

!!! tip ""
    **EFB/ATSU Improvements** 

    We've incorporated the reliable NOAA ([aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/)) as a METAR source, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date weather 
    data. 

    Additionally, our system can utilize MSFS METAR data, moving away from the older FSX cloud data originally provided through the FBW API. This will ensure a more synchronized weather experience in your flight deck.

    **EFB/FWC Update**

    Automatic Call-Outs are selectable in the flyPad. The basic configuration offered by Airbus is set as the default.

    **EFB/Payloads Enhancements**

    Pilots have the capability for multi-gate boarding whenever multiple doors are open, streamlining the boarding process and saving time.

    !!! warning "Lack of Animation"
        Please note that due to Asobo model issues the animation of the left aft door will not be visible. Use the EFB or lower ECAM to verify the door status of the aircraft.

        This will be fixed when we have completed our own custom model of the A32NX.

    You'll also receive a user-friendly UI message on the fuel/payload page when GSX is activated, ensuring clearer communication between the two systems.

    **EFB Functional Upgrades**

    We've added a few notable functional changes, such as a "Pause at T/D" function. SimBridge connectivity issues have also been addressed.

    The main dashboard and landing calculator have been refined to use your selected METAR source for a consistent weather information feed.

    **EFB Cosmetic Enhancements**

    We've rolled out aesthetic updates to the throttle configuration settings, while also expanding support for multiple airframes. This ensures our flyPad is compatible with 
    our future aircraft releases, maintaining versatility between our products.

[flyPadOS Guides Here](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/flypados3/index.md){.md-button}

### Crossbleed Engine Starts

Pilots are able to initiate an engine start from crossbleed air. This procedure is performed when the APU Bleed start is not possible. For more information and procedure, visit our dedicated [Crossbleed Engine Start](../../pilots-corner/a32nx/a32nx-advanced-guides/engines/crossbleed-start.md) page.

We have further expanded our suite of sensor simulation in the aircraft to support this feature.

!!! tip "" 
    **Engine and Crossbleed Updates**

    - Initiate engine start from crossbleed air.
    - Fully open/fully closed sensors for the crossbleed valve.
    - Crossbleed valve indications for open, closed, and in-transfer status.

    **Sensor Implementations**

    - Pressure sensors for regulated, transfer, and precooler inlet pressures.
    - Precooler outlet temperature sensor.

    **SD Bleed Page Enhancements**

    - Updated SD Bleed page indications.
    - Adjusted precooler inlet pressure's green/amber logic.
    - 5-second confirmation before displaying a closed indication for the pressure regulating valve.

    **BMC and ECAM Updates**
    
    - Bleed air overpressure, underpressure, and overheat detection in the BMC.

    **Valve and Regulation Improvements**

    - Enhanced fan air valve regulation logic.
    - Overpressure valve implemented. 
    - Reworked high-pressure valve regulation.

    **Physics and Efficiency Updates**

    - Reworked engine compressor physics. 
    - Increased precooler cooling efficiency. 
    - Tuned APU bleed pressure.

    **Fault Light Logic**

    - Reworked pack fault light logic for better accuracy.

### Air Conditioning Simulation

This release introduces a realistically simulated intricate model of the Air Conditioning System tailored specifically to emulate an A320 equipped with an ACSC (Air Conditioning System Controller). Key additions include:

- ARINC Discrete Communication: To ensure high-fidelity data transfer and system controls.
- Valve Simulation and Dynamics: Detailed simulation of the TAPRV (Trim Air Pressure Regulating Valve) and TAV (Trim Air Valves) have been introduced. Along with this, users will observe a more realistic temperature response time from the pack, further enhancing the immersion until packs are fully modeled.
- System Failures: A crucial aspect of any simulation is the unpredictability and the challenges it presents. Pilots can set failures in various components. See our 
  [Custom Air Conditioning](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/custom-air-conditioning.md) page for more information.
  - Additional Failures Introduced: For those seeking an added layer of challenge and immersion, we've implemented scenarios like trim air system high-pressure malfunctions and duct overheats. 

### Flight Data Recorder Improvements

The virtual Flight Data Recorder (FDR) now includes secondary engine parameters.

Many may not be aware, but the A32NX actually has an onboard FDR. This is a crucial component in the aircraft that records and logs various parameters and events. In real-life scenarios, this data is essential for analyzing and investigation incidents or accidents that may occur.

For the purposes of simulation, our support teams use it for providing technical support to our users and analyzing the same parameters and events. It allows us to troubleshoot abnormal aircraft or display behavior caused by pilot error, a hardware issue, an MSFS issue, or a bug in our simulation.

We have also built our own flight data recorder analysis tool that allows us to parse the data you've sent us and visualize it in a way that allows us to quickly identify the issues above. 

!!! tip "Snapshotting an Event"
    You can use the DFDR button found on the lower pedestal to mark a point in time within the recorded data so that we can quickly find the event you're reporting. Location of 
    the DFDR button can be found [here](../../pilots-corner/a32nx/a32nx-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/lighting-aids-dfdr.md).

    Visit our Discord for instructions on how to supply us this data if requested.

### Flight Instrument Improvements

!!! tip ""
    **MCDU/ND**

    Navigation Display (ND) corrections include fixing ROSE VOR/LS conditions and ILS course and masking the map beneath the TCAS/WXR and FM messages. We've also corrected 
    altitude formatting in relation to transition altitude and transition level.

    **PFD**

    The Primary Flight Display (PFD) has received adjustments in the size of pitch trim messages. Also, the NO DH logic in the FMS and PFD has been corrected.

    **SD**

    System Display (SD) updates involve a new 3-second display duration for the STS page. The SD BLEED page correctly shows the APU bleed pressure indication. Corrections have been made in the fuel transfer valve amber logic, the position of outer tank fuel quantity values, and adjustments to the thickness and position of lower ECAM fuel page lines.

    **ISIS**

    A fix has been implemented for the ISIS alt tape, ensuring correct order representation for negative altitudes. The team has spent countless hours looking over real life 
    references to ensure that the layout is 1:1 with the A320neo

### General Improvements

The A32NX FMS has seen a host of updates and improvements. These include setting a default RNP of 0.3 for RNP AR procedure legs, adding basic support for FA legs, implementing the CHECK SPEED MODE message, vertical navigation functions, and more. 

Layout adjustments have been made to the PERF CLB, PERF CRZ, and PERF DES pages for better clarity. Additionally, the robustness of ILS selection has been improved, and procedures referencing runways are loaded correctly. Other enhancements include displaying ILS identification and frequency on the ARRIVAL page, improved fuel warnings post-engine start, and appropriate use of station declination.

The MCDU has also seen multiple updates. This includes basic MCDU MENU functionality, annunciator support, and improvements in V-speed calculations. A few bugs, such as the FMGC annunciator light not illuminating and demanding QNH and TEMP readings when distant from the destination, have been addressed. The ZFW/ZFWCG autofill feature has been optimized to use desired values during the boarding process.

For users utilizing external hardware, remote MCDU protocol enhancements include the transmission of annunciator light state, display, integral light brightness, and support for BRT/DIM keys.
