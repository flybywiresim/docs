# Stable Release v0.9.1

We've released a small patch to fix the metadata found in MSFS content manager to properly reflect the stable 
version is installed. We've also contacted our ground staff to properly switch the INOP sticker to the correct colors.

All flights are now cleared for departure. Happy Flying!
