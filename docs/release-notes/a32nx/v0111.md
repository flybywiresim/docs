# Stable Release v0.11.1

This update primarily addresses some minor issues that were present in our previous stable release. Specifically, we have resolved a problem when a runway is missing from the
base sim, but the navdata has been added externally (e.g. Navigraph).

Happy Flying!

    **Navigraph Airframe**

    The team at Navigraph have been kind enough to include our airframe as a selectable option on SimBrief. You no longer have to save our custom airframe to your account to 
    use it. If we decide to make any changes, it will be automatically updated in their system.
