## Feature Details

### Autotuning

Autotuning is a feature that automatically tunes the NAVAIDS on the A32NX. It works by using a database of available NAVAIDS in the area and selecting the appropriate ones based on the aircraft's 
position and flight plan. The FMS will periodically scan for new NAVAIDS and automatically tune the appropriate radio receivers. Autotuning takes into account various factors such as signal 
strength, distance, and accuracy to determine which NAVAIDS to use.

Overall, autotuning simplifies the navigation process for pilots and allows them to focus on other critical aspects of the flight. It is a valuable feature that improves the safety and efficiency of the aircraft.

### FMGC + FMS + FWC

We have been hard at work making some significant improvements to the aircraft's Flight Management and Guidance systems. The team has implemented exposure of the minimums to the PFD and made some changes to the PERF GO AROUND page layout to make it more user-friendly. Constraints for waypoints behind the aircraft have been added and we have also fixed bugs related to thrust reduction and acceleration altitude.

The FMS now includes handling approach transitions hidden inside other transitions with Navigraph data, implementing FMS LS tuning lock below 700 feet on approach, and making ILS course and slope 
available for database NAVAIDS.

We are now targeting a modern version of the Flight Warning Computer, adding warnings for fuel low, flap lever not zero, ground spoiler not armed, and speed brake still out.

Overall, these changes represent significant improvements to the aircraft's systems.

### Hydraulics

The latest update for the aircraft includes a comprehensive set of changes to the hydraulic system. The update introduces priority valves, adjusted low-speed pump efficiency, basic temperature 
simulation, and faster core hydraulic solvers to improve performance.

The new update also features a realistic randomized yellow accumulator starting state, a new aerodynamic model for the RAT turbine, and the addition of the A320 RAT anti-stall valve system. Our 
systems coding for the RAT allows for both hydraulic or electrical RAT design.

The rudder mechanical assembly, yaw dampers, and trimmable physical assemblies are now simulated. The THS specifically has been designed to work with both mechanical and electrical control, 
providing users with a more realistic and engaging flying experience.

### MCDU + ND

We're excited to announce the latest update to our MCDU + ND software, featuring several new improvements and fixes. The new SPECIF VOR/D UNAVAIL message ensures you'll always be notified of any 
unavailable navigation aids. We've also fixed issues with EFOB and FUEL PRED getting dashed out at TOD, and negative EFOB values on both the F-PLN and FLIGHT PLAN pages.

Navigation is now smoother and more precise than ever, thanks to our new NAVAID and SELECTED NAVAIDS pages, and the re-implementation of the RADIO NAV page for enhanced control. We've also added new TUNE BBB FFF.FF and SPECIF NDB UNAVAIL messages to keep you informed at all times.

We've also made significant improvements to the ND display, including not drawing the background when busses are not powered, fixing LOC deviation scaling, and improving the consistency of RNP <= 0.3 indications. Additionally, the accuracy of the plane icon has been enhanced, allowing for even more precise navigation.

All of these improvements were made by our dedicated team, ensuring you have the best experience possible when using our MCDU/ND software. Don't forget, we've also added a reset of flight plan and stored data on Database switch, making your experience even smoother.
