## Feature Details

### Autotuning

Autotuning is a feature that automatically tunes the NAVAIDS on the A32NX. It works by using a database of available NAVAIDS in the area and selecting the appropriate ones based on the aircraft's 
position and flight plan. The FMS will periodically scan for new NAVAIDS and automatically tune the appropriate radio receivers. Autotuning takes into account various factors such as signal 
strength, distance, and accuracy to determine which NAVAIDS to use.

When performing an approach, pilots can VOR and RNAV navaids to assist with navigation. If another navaid is manually tuned, we have implemented the appropriate warning messages which appear 
in the scratchpad. Any specified navaid when deselected will trigger an alert on the SEL NAVAIDS page on the ND and will not be tuned automatically.

NDBs will also be automatically tuned when an NDB based approach is active, and a warning message will appear if a specified NDB is deselected. The CRS field for the VORs will not be displayed 
when a DME only navaid is tuned by ident.

Alternate control can be utilized via the RMP to enable backup tuning by selecting the NAV button. This will cause the RAD NAV page on the MCDU to go blank, and the FMGC will no longer tune any 
navaids.

The ILS frequency is automatically tuned for the departure runway and when the aircraft is within 250NM of the destination airport. Scratchpad warning messages will appear if the ILS or ILS CRS 
are set to different values.

Overall, autotuning simplifies the navigation process for pilots and allows them to focus on other critical aspects of the flight. It is a valuable feature that improves the safety and efficiency of the aircraft.

### Air Conditioning Simulation

**WIP**

### flyPadOS 3 Updates

The flyPadOS 3 (EFB) now has some improvements to various existing features as well as GSX integration for those users that utilize the application.

Notably, in conjunction with our flight model changes and payload, the EFB now features a revamped weight and balance system without drastically changing the user interface. We have retooled this
process code-wise allowing for more complex manipulation resulting in better performance. While our users will continue to enjoy customizing baggage and seating through the EFB, we now have better
support for mixed seating classes and staggered rows. Applied "on top" of our GSX integration this essentially means 3rd party programs can interact better with our aircraft and even set seating
layouts.

GSX integration features supported include refueling, boarding, and cargo. While we have some limitations in place due to Asobo's model and animations we have done our best to make the experience
to sync GSX features through the EFB as seamless as possible. These limitations are most notable with utilizing the rear cargo door or passenger doors and require special toggles on our EFB.

You can read more about our GSX integration [here](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/gsxintegration/index.md).

QuickControls have been added to the EFB to allow for quick access to important features like EFB brightness, or controlling the SimBridge connection, instant boarding or instant ADIRS alignment.
See our documentation for more information: [Quick Controls Documentation](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/flypados3/index.md#quick-controls)

The EFB Pushback System can now be fully controlled via API and therefore mapped to hardware buttons or controllers. See our
documentation for more information: [Pushback API](../fbw-a32nx/a32nx-api/a32nx-flightdeck-api.md#pushback-api)

We also continue to improve and perfect on our translations for the EFB which would not be possible without the amazing support from our community. It also would not be possible without our great partners at Localazy who have provided us with a great platform to manage our translations.

!!! note ""
    We are always looking for more help with translations. You can find more information on how to do so through our documentation [here](../dev-corner/dev-guide/specific/flypad-translations.md).

TODO:

- Improved/fixed Flight Plan Import from MSFS World Map
- Version Check and Notification


### FMGC + FMS + FWC

We have been hard at work making some significant improvements to the aircraft's Flight Management and Guidance systems. 

We've made changes to the PERF GO AROUND page layout to better reflect the Honeywell Release 3. Additionally, we have exposed minimums to the PFD through the BnrArinc when in CRZ or later and within 
200NM of the destination. Constraints for waypoints behind the aircraft have also been added. 

The FMS now handles approach transitions hidden inside other transitions with Navigraph data, implementing FMS LS tuning lock below 700 feet on approach, and making ILS course and slope 
available for database NAVAIDS.

We are also now targeting a more modern version of the Flight Warning Computer, adding warnings for fuel low, flap lever not zero, ground spoiler not armed, and speed brake still out.

Minor bugs related to thrust reduction and acceleration altitude have been fixed.

### Hydraulics

The latest update for the aircraft includes a comprehensive set of changes to the hydraulic system.

Priority valves are now simulated and might cause some high flow consumer to behave poorly in some circumstances, for example the gear or flaps/slats while the plane is in abnormal hydraulic situation.

A new temperature simulation was added, and allows the system to react realistically to various type of failures, including hydraulic elements that might fail in a chain reaction if you don't react quickly enough. For example, letting the PTU run on an empty green or yellow system might cause the healthy system to overheat, thus losing both green and yellow... Not ideal!

Small detail added is the yellow brake accumulator that has now its state randomly generated when starting a flight. In some rare cases you might start with an empty brake accumulator: be careful with your checklist!

RAT turbine has now a new realistic aerodynamic model, and the addition of the anti-stall valve system. This system reduce the load of the hydraulic pump when RAT speed is too low, preventing it from stalling at low approach speeds. A new electrical 1.6m diameter RAT is also available for bigger planes.

The complete rudder mechanical assembly, electrical control, hydraulic assembly, and hydraulic yaw dampers are now simulated. Trying to move the trim wheel without hydraulic power will only let you move it a tiny bit, as the tension of the control cables increases. A new electrical control THS has also been developped for bigger planes.

### MCDU + ND

We're excited to announce the latest update to our MCDU + ND software. The new SPECIF VOR/D UNAVAIL message ensures you'll always be notified of any 
unavailable navigation aids. We've also fixed issues with EFOB and FUEL PRED getting dashed out at TOD, and negative EFOB values on both the F-PLN and FLIGHT PLAN pages.

There are also new NAVAID and SELECTED NAVAIDS pages, and the re-implementation of the RADIO NAV. Many of these new features have already been detailed in the [Autotuning](#autotuning) section.

The ND display no longer draws the background when busses are not powered, fixing LOC deviation scaling, and improving the consistency of RNP <= 0.3 indications. 

We've also added a reset of flight plan and stored data on Database switch. 

### Terrain on ND

Our terrain database is now finally on our Stable version rounding out our current SimBridge enabled features. With SimBridge enabled during flights pilots operating in regions with hazardous terrain 
conditions now have additional situational awareness to help them navigate safely. This is all possible with the Terrain Awareness and Warning System which overlays the Terrain Awareness and 
Display which overlays the terrain on to the ND. Read more through our guide below.

[Terrain on ND Guides](../simbridge/simbridge-feature-guides/terrain.md){.md-button}

## Misc

### Miscellaneous

Using the MSFS built-in flight planning via the MSFS World Map is still important for many users, although less realistic than using SimBrief or other planning tools. Therefore, we have improved 
the import process to better handle the MSFS flight-plan data and allow for more accurate imported flight plans.

Read more in our [Flight Planning Guide](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/flight-planning.md)

To ensure that users are always using the latest version of our aircraft, we have added a version check and user notification to inform users if their version is some time behind the latest 
released version. This will help us to ensure that users always have the latest features and bug fixes.
