## Custom Flight Management System

A crucial part of every IFR flight is planning your route, departures, and arrivals. Our new custom flight management focuses on bringing the system architecture even closer to 
how the real A320 handles FMS data and the interactions.

We have completed major improvements to the LNAV portion of the custom FMS. This in turn has allows the FMS to have full authority on drawing the flight plan. With a wide 
support for various procedure leg types you should experience flight paths that are more accurate to real life lateral SID/STAR constraints encoded in the navdata, better 
flight path prediction, and *finally* programmable holds!

Additionally, we've also included the following features:

- [Fix Info](#) to create waypoint intersections in your flight plan.
- [Stored Waypoints](#) to enter and store up to 99 custom waypoints.
- [Discontinuities](#) are inserted into the F-PLN accordingly

To learn more about our custom FMS see our documentation - [here](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS.md)

## Hydraulics

A large amount of work has been done to create and implement a realistic simulation of various hydraulic systems in the A32NX. This update features all control surfaces hydraulic control loop (visual and hydraulic only), leak measurement valves, a physics based PTU model, emergency hydraulic motor/generator simulation supplied by RAT (no 3D model yet), and even our first iteration of the custom bleed system, impacting hydraulic reservoir pressurisation. 

You may even notice the aileron droop when the aircraft is unpowered at the gate commonly known as "aileron droop". This even means that heavy winds on the ground can displace the rudder visually when unpowered, while the aerodynamic model can affect moving parts.

As a part of the hydraulic update we have also made the ground handling much more realistic and have finally implemented steering via the [tiller](#separated-tiller)

We have written a dedicated NOTAM [Hydraulics Development Update](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/hydraulics-update-2022/) that explains a lot of these changes in detail.

## Separated Tiller

Previously most users opt to use the rudder axis to steer the aircraft on the ground. Now nose wheel steering can now be accomplished via the tiller! This handwheel is utilized to 
turn the nose wheel during taxi up to 75Â° to the left or right creating a more realistic taxi experience in the simulator.

## CPDLC Hoppie ACARS

Trying to get a non-urgent message on a VATSIM/IVAO but there are too many critical instructions on frequency? Use our CPDLC implementation! While this is a constant "in 
development" feature it currently supports both networks for relaying two-way data-linked messages as an alternative to voice communications. 

This entire implementation is a realistic realization of the ATS 623 standard.

## TCAS

Our implementation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is based on TCAS 7.1 a first among all Airbus simulation addons. This includes the AP/FD TCAS feature that 
provides vertical guidance as part of the Auto Flight System (AFS).

The A32NX can detect TCAS TAs and provide autopilot guided TCAS RA maneuvers on both VATSIM/IVAO networks and the live traffic feature in MSFS. *It does not support MSFS 
multiplayer*.
