## Custom Flight Management System

A crucial part of every IFR flight is planning your route, departures, and arrivals. Our new custom flight management focuses on bringing the system architecture even closer to 
how the real A320 handles FMS data and the interactions.

We have completed major improvements to the LNAV portion of the custom FMS. This in turn allows the FMS to have full authority on drawing the flight plan. With a wide
support for various procedure leg types, the plane should fly paths that are more accurate to real life lateral SID/STAR constraints encoded in the navdata, better
flight path prediction, and *finally* programmable holds!

Additionally, we have also included the following features:

- [Fix Info](../pilots-corner/advanced-guides/flight-planning/fixinfo.md) to create waypoint intersections in your flight plan.
- [Stored Waypoints](../pilots-corner/advanced-guides/data-management.md) to enter and store up to 99 custom waypoints.
- [Discontinuities](../pilots-corner/advanced-guides/flight-planning/disco.md) are inserted into the F-PLN accordingly.

## Hydraulics

A large amount of work has been done to create and implement a realistic simulation of various hydraulic systems in the A32NX. This update features all control surfaces hydraulic control loop (visual and hydraulic only), leak measurement valves, a physics based PTU model, emergency hydraulic motor/generator simulation supplied by RAT (no 3D model yet), and even our first iteration of the custom bleed system, impacting hydraulic reservoir pressurisation. 

You may even notice the aileron droop when the aircraft is unpowered at the gate. In addition, heavy winds on the ground can now displace the rudder visually when the aircraft is unpowered. This is because the aerodynamic model can now affect moving parts.

As part of the hydraulic update, we have also made ground handling much more realistic and have finally implemented steering via the [tiller](#separated-tiller).

!!! tip "Deep Dive"
    Check out our dedicated [Hydraulics Development Update NOTAM](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/hydraulics-update-2022/){target=new} that explains a lot of these changes in detail.

### Separated Tiller

Previously, most users opted to use the rudder axis to steer the aircraft on the ground. Now, nose wheel steering can be accomplished via the tiller! It is used to turn the nose wheel during taxi up to 75° to the left or right, giving users a more realistic taxi experience in the simulator.

## CPDLC Hoppie ACARS

Trying to get a non-urgent message on a VATSIM/IVAO but there are too many critical instructions on frequency? Use our CPDLC implementation! While this is a constant "in 
development" feature, it currently supports both networks for relaying two-way data-linked messages as an alternative to voice communications.

This entire implementation is a realistic realisation of the ATS 623 standard.

## TCAS

Our implementation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is based on TCAS 7.1, a first among all Airbus simulation addons. This includes the AP/FD TCAS feature that 
provides vertical guidance as part of the Auto Flight System (AFS).

The A32NX can detect TCAS TAs and provide autopilot guided TCAS RA manoeuvres on both VATSIM/IVAO networks and the live traffic feature in MSFS. *It does not support MSFS 
multiplayer*.

## Cockpit Textures

We have carefully crafted new textures in the virtual cockpit representative of a well used A320neo while still reflective of its relatively young age in the Airbus family.

## MCDU Web Interface

You can now use the MCDU externally through a browser on your PC on your mobile device on your home networks! Feel like setting up your flight on your iPad while sitting on your couch? Well, you can do that now!

## Display Typeface Improvements

Systems modelling is important, but we dare not abandon the quest for visual accuracy. We have spent countless hours creating custom typefaces to ensure that each system you 
interact with has accurate typography and fonts.

!!! tip "Deep Dive"
    Our [Features and Projects NOTAM](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/features-and-projects/){target=new} discusses the methodology behind developing the typefaces for the A32NX.

## AP, FBW, and A/THR Improvements

Our commitment to realism and accuracy means that the work is never finished! We have ensured that these systems are more robust in handling various conditions in different
phases of flight. Please see our curated list below for new features and improved/fixed systems.

!!! tip "Deep Dive"
    To learn about the development process of these systems, check out our [Systems NOTAM](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/systems_notam-2022-02/){target=new} published in
    February.

## Various Improvements and Optimizations

We have improved almost every aspect of the A32NX from our previous release (v0.7.0). Features you already enjoy such as the flyPadOS 2 have seen changes and improvements to UI 
elements and how the data is handled. We have modeled cabin temperature control and simulation while also improving the pack flow model. Our external lighting systems have been
improved to have better logic, ambience, and are synced in their behaviors.

We have been able to edit aspects of the A320neo model. While not a complete overhaul, we've been able to add new texturing, decal and livery improvements for livery creators, heat
effect changes on the engines, and even landing lights that retract fully and independently. We have also finally allowed the first officer to use the flyPad.

![First Officer EFB](assets/efb-firstofficer.png){loading=lazy}

Our new PFD includes EIS S14 features with improved behaviour in numerous aspects. We have also made it lighter on frames, improving performance in the simulator.

As there are too many features to outline here, please check out our full changelog below for more information.
