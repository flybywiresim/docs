## Custom Flight Management System

A crucial part of every IFR flight is planning your route, departures, and arrivals. Our new custom flight management focuses on bringing the system architecture even closer to 
how the real A320 handles FMS data and the interactions.

We have completed major improvements to the LNAV portion of the custom FMS. This in turn has allows the FMS to have full authority on drawing the flight plan. With a wide 
support for various procedure leg types you should experience flight paths that are more accurate to real life lateral SID/STAR constraints encoded in the navdata, better 
flight path prediction, and *finally* programmable holds!

Additionally, we've also included the following features:

- [Fix Info](#) to create waypoint intersections in your flight plan.
- [Stored Waypoints](#) to enter and store up to 99 custom waypoints.
- [Discontinuities](#) are inserted into the F-PLN accordingly

To learn more about our custom FMS see our documentation - [here](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS.md)

## Hydraulics

A large amount of work has been done to create and implement a realistic simulation of various hydraulic systems in the A32NX. This update features all control surfaces hydraulic control loop (visual and hydraulic only), leak measurement valves, a physics based PTU model, emergency hydraulic motor/generator simulation supplied by RAT (no 3D model yet), and even our first iteration of the custom bleed system, impacting hydraulic reservoir pressurisation. 

You may even notice the aileron droop when the aircraft is unpowered at the gate commonly known as "aileron droop". This even means that heavy winds on the ground can displace the rudder visually when unpowered, while the aerodynamic model can affect moving parts.

As a part of the hydraulic update we have also made the ground handling much more realistic and have finally implemented steering via the [tiller](#separated-tiller).

We have written a dedicated NOTAM [Hydraulics Development Update](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/hydraulics-update-2022/) that explains a lot of these changes in detail.

### Separated Tiller

Previously most users opt to use the rudder axis to steer the aircraft on the ground. Now nose wheel steering can now be accomplished via the tiller! This handwheel is utilized to 
turn the nose wheel during taxi up to 75Â° to the left or right creating a more realistic taxi experience in the simulator.

## CPDLC Hoppie ACARS

Trying to get a non-urgent message on a VATSIM/IVAO but there are too many critical instructions on frequency? Use our CPDLC implementation! While this is a constant "in 
development" feature it currently supports both networks for relaying two-way data-linked messages as an alternative to voice communications. 

This entire implementation is a realistic realization of the ATS 623 standard.

## TCAS

Our implementation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is based on TCAS 7.1 a first among all Airbus simulation addons. This includes the AP/FD TCAS feature that 
provides vertical guidance as part of the Auto Flight System (AFS).

The A32NX can detect TCAS TAs and provide autopilot guided TCAS RA maneuvers on both VATSIM/IVAO networks and the live traffic feature in MSFS. *It does not support MSFS 
multiplayer*.

You can read more in our [TCAS Guide](../pilots-corner/advanced-guides/flight-guidance/tcas.md)

## Cockpit Textures

## MCDU Web Interface

You can now use the MCDU externally through a browser on your PC on your mobile device on your home networks! Feel like setting up your flight on your iPad while sitting on 
your couch? Well. You can do that now!

## Display Typeface Improvements

## AP, FBW, and A/THR Improvements

Our commitment to realism and accuracy means that the work is never finished! We have ensured that these systems are more robust in handling various conditions in different
phases of flight. Please see our curated list below for new features and improved/fixed systems.

!!! tip "Deep Dive"
    To learn about the development process of these systems, check out our [Systems NOTAM](https://flybywiresim.com/notams/systems_notam-2022-02/){target=new} published in
    February.

### AP

#### New
- TCAS modes
- Autoland capability for runways with special terrain profile (KSEA 16R)
- Option to use calculated ILS signal
- Allow deactivation of A. FLOOR by disconnecting ATHR
- Load factor and roll rate limits are now applied per law
- Added ALT being armed on ground when CLB is not armed

#### Improved / Fixed
- Improved LOC*, LOC, G/S*, G/S, FLARE, ROLLOUT laws
- Improved speed protection of V/S, FPA, ALT*
- Improved conditions of ALT*, ALT
- Improved conditions of ALT CST*, ALT CST
- Improved HDG and TRACK law for small changes in course
- Improved engagement of OP CLB/DES modes (in coordination with ATHR)
- Improved SRS engagement conditions
- Removed V/S sub mode for CLB, OP CLB and DES when change is less than 1200 ft
- Improved SPD/MACH law

### ATHR

#### New
- Thrust limits redone
- Added distinct retard mode for Autoland (that uses a different N1 rate than THR IDLE)
- FLX thrust is now limiting CLB on entry, realistic transition to default CLB after take-off

#### Improved / Fixed
- Improved SPEED law that uses load-factor and improves scenarios with low N1 when flying transition from descend to level off
- Improved THR CLB and THR IDLE modes
- Improved SOFT ALT mode
- Improved accuracy to achieve N1 target (N1 control base loop)

### FBW

#### New
- Reworked roll law
- Reworked yaw law for side slip control and turn coordination
- Pitch attitude and load factor limits are now also applied in High-AoA protection

#### Improved / Fixed
- Improved pitch law
  - Increased pitch rate of C* law
  - Improved normal law flight path stability when speed is increased or decreased
- Improved stability in turbulent weather
- Improved FLARE mode (manual flight)

## Various Improvements and Optimizations

We improved almost every aspect of the A32NX from our previous release v0.7.0. Features you already enjoy such as the flyPadOS 2 has seen changes and improvements to UI 
elements and how the data is handled. We've modeled cabin temperature control and simulation while also improving the pack flow model. Our external lighting systems have been 
improved to have better logic, ambience, and are synced in their behaviors.

We've been able to edit aspects of the A320neo model. While not a complete rehaul we've been able to add new texturing, decal and livery improvements for livery creators, heat 
effect changes on the engines, and even landing lights that retract fully and indepedently.

Our new PFD has seen EiS S14 features with improve behaviours in numerous places. We have also made it lighter on frames improving performance in the simulator.

While there are just too many features to outline please check out our full changelog below!
