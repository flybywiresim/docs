## Custom Fly-by-Wire Autopilot and Autothrust System

These systems have been built from the ground up to provide a robust realistic experience throughout all stages of flight. You can now enjoy expert handling of the A32NX when utilizing the autopilot with better climb performance, flight dynamics, and accurate FMA indications on our redesigned PFD.

Additionally, we have also included several features of note:

- Dual AP autoland
- Alpha Floor protections
- Automatic SPD/MACH switching
- Fly-By-Wire Normal Law
    - C* law with proper limits (+2.5g/-1.0g in clean, +2.0g/0.0g with flaps)
    - Auto-Trim
    - Flare law
    - Rotation law (with optional tailstrike protection)
    - Yaw damper
    - Roll limits
- Reworked managed speed management
- ILS auto-tuning for departure and improved for approach

!!! warning "Take Note"
    For now only normal law is supported at the moment.

    Throttle detent calibration is now required - [Read Here](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/flypados3/throttle-calibration.md)

## Custom Engine Model

The engine model now supports a realistic cold engine start-up process based on the primary parameters spooling the engines as a function of pressure and temperature. We have implemented custom EGT and fuel flow logic additionally adapting the engine IDLE N1 to be based on the environment conditions of the aircraft in the simulator.

Our engine model supports the above custom autopilot and fly-by-wire system.

## Custom Systems

Our team has been hard at work creating realistic simulations of various systems in the A32NX.

### Pressurization

Initial implementation of the automatic mode for the pressurisation system. This brings a first simulation of the CPC and outflow valve, while managing cabin pressure and rate using engine parameters and landing field elevation.

### Hydraulics

Major steps have been taken to bring an accurate hydraulics system to the A32NX. This has allowed for more realistic braking action both manually and with the custom autobrake to provide for better dynamic deceleration targets of the real A320neo. These hydraulics have also been connected to our electrical system.

For a great overview of this implementation check out 320 Sim Pilot's video:

### ADIRS System

We have created an advanced ADIRS implementation that allows for separated ADIRUs allowing for improved functionality in the A32NX. Previously having only one ADIRU aligned would allow the PFD and ND on both sides to fully work. This system now allows for ADR and IR systems to be pushed OFF to disconnect the output and the resulting information is reflective on both the PFD and ND.

See our Developer Series video for more information:

### Electrical System

One of our largest custom systems is the electrical system. Each individual aircraft light, display unit, and windscreen wiper is now accurately powered by the correct electrical bus. If some electrical systems is lost or the flight crew turned them off the A32NX will react accordingly - even keeping the engines running when all electrical systems are lost.

You can see some examples below of how the aircraft lights and systems react when certain electrical systems are not working properly.

**Exterior Lights**

**Interior Lights and Avionics**

![interior lights](assets/int-lt.jpg "interior lights"){loading=lazy}

## Overhauled Avionics System

The overhaul encompasses both features and increased performance reliability for improved frame rates. We've added realistic symbology and functionality to the avionics including:

- Baro setting flashing
- VOR/ADF needles on the ILS arc display
- True to spec pixelation on avionics
- Auto-brightness
- BRG/DIST on the MCDU

As a convenience feature, keyboard input is now available on the MCDU - [Guide Here](../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/mcdu-keyboard.md).

## EFB flyPadOS v2

Major improvements have gone into the flyPad onboard the A32NX. This update provides an entirely overhauled UI for all the features you are already accustomed to, creating a more refined experience and improved usability. The settings page has been reworked and many features ported over from the MCDU.

We also introduced two new major features with this version:

- Landing performance calculator.
- Navigraph charts integration built in.

## Reworked Cockpit Textures

As we work towards creating our own A320neo model we have completed an overhaul of the cockpit textures in the A32NX. There is now visible wear and tear across the entire flight deck creating the feel of a real world cockpit.

![Textures](assets/textures1.jpg "Textures"){loading=lazy}

![Textures](assets/textures2.jpg "Textures"){loading=lazy}

## Improved Soundscape

Our sound engineer continuously tweaks and improves the digital soundscape from both within the flight deck and on the outside. Using real world references and verified by our pilot staff the A32NX now provides an immersive experience throughout the power up sequence, engine start, flight, cockpit interaction and aircraft shutdown.

We are happy to note that we have replaced all remaining Asobo sounds.
