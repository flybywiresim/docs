## Real Life Considerations

## Manual Vertical Modes

### OP CLB

### OP DES

### V/S and FPA

### Expedite

## Managed Vertical Modes

- Accounts for altitude constraints at waypoints
- Accounts for speed constraints at waypoints (when in Managed Speed Mode)
- Energy and speed management
- Descent Profile Computation

### CLB

### DES

#### Managed Speed in DES

- ECON DES speed or the descent speed manually entered in the PERF DES page of the FMS, or
- The speed constraint, or
- The manoeuvring speed of the current aircraft configuration, or
- VAPP.

#### Decelerated Approach (without CDA)

#### Continuous Descent Approach (CDA)
