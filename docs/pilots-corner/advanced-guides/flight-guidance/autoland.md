        - Summary
            - Check aircraft, crew and airport capability
            - Minima - CAT??
            - both AP
            - Monitor FMAs
            - be prepared to GA any time if aircraft does not behave as expected

## Introduction

- not used everytime - in fact rarely
- more stressful for pilots than normal landings
- pilot is always responsible and needs to be prepared to GA any time if aircraft does not behave as expected
- should not replace learning how to land manually!

## Real World Considerations

### When to Use Autoland

- weather conditions
- pilot training - pilots need to do this regularly to keep certification

### Crew Requirements

- training and certification

### Airport Requirements

- CAT III ???
- ???

## Autoland HowTo

### Preparations

- Check aircraft, crew and airport capability
- Check Limitations - cross winds
- Check aircraft status
- Minima - CAT??

### ILS Approach

- normal ILS plus dual AP

### FMA Annunciations

- AP 1+2
- A/THR
- CAT IIIB (alarm when downgraded)
- MINIA (NO DH)
- LOC / G/S
- SPEED

- LAND (350ft)
- FLARE (30ft)
- THRUST IDLE (30ft)
- ROLL OUT (nosewheel touchdown)

### Crew Checks and Callouts

- LOC / GS
- LAND (350ft)
- FLARE (30ft)
- THRUST IDLE (30ft)
    - Retard Callout (10ft)
- Touchdown:
    - Spoilers
    - Reversers
    - Descel
- ROLL OUT (nosewheel touchdown)

### Flow From 1000ft

- step by step pilot (PF) actions

### Go Around

- when
- how

### When Things go Wrong

- fly manually
- do go around
