# Rejected Takeoff in the A320

The term rejected takeoff (also known as RTO) refers to incidents in which an aircraft's pilots elect to abort their 
departure before reaching a critical speed. 

This critical speed is known as 'V1', and this refers to the maximum speed an aircraft can reach on its takeoff roll and then be brought to a stop 
whilst remaining within the accelerate-stop distance (the distance the airplane actually needs to accelerate and stop in accordance with regulations). 
If the aircraft reaches this speed and the Pilot Flying has not yet taken action to stop the plane, the takeoff must be continued unless the airplane is unsafe to fly.

??? tip "Extra Knowledge - ASDA (Click to Expand)"
    Another similar term is accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA) which covers the length of runway and stopway that is available for an 
    accelerate-stop. This distance can be longer than the accelerate-stop distance. 

When the aircraft speed is at or above 100 kts, it may become hazardous to reject a takeoff, therefore a takeoff is split into 3 phases:  

- Below 100 kts  
- Above 100 kts and below V1  
- Above V1  

!!! warning "Attention"

    If the takeoff is rejected below 72 kts, spoilers & autobrakes will not activate, therefore full manual braking would be required in addition to the other stop actions listed in the rejected takeoff procedure.

## What Happens During a Rejected Takeoff in Real Life?

The decision to reject the takeoff and the stop action is made by the Captain, it is therefore recommended that the Captain keeps his hand on the thrust levers until the aircraft reaches V1, whether he is Pilot Flying (PF) or Pilot Not Flying (PNF).

As soon as the Captain decides to abort, he calls “STOP”, takes over control of the aircraft, and performs the stop actions.

## Reasons for a Rejected Takeoff  

It is not possible to list all the factors that could lead to the decision to reject the takeoff. However, in order to help the Captain make a decision, the ECAM inhibits warnings that are not essential once the plane passes 80 kts and stops inhibiting them once the plane reaches 1500 ft AGL (or 2 min after lift-off, whichever occurs first). A magenta T.O INHIBIT memo is displayed in the Upper ECAM (E/WD) to inform the pilots of this.

- Below 100 kts:  
    - Any ECAM warning/caution should prompt the Captain to seriously consider discontinuing the takeoff
- Above 100 kts and below V1:  
    - Fire warning or severe damage
    - Sudden loss of engine thrust
    - Any red ECAM warning
    - Any amber ECAM caution listed below:
        - F/CTL SIDESTICK FAULT
        - ENG FAIL
        - ENG REVERSE FAULT
        - ENG REVERSE UNLOCKED
        - ENG 1(2) THR LEVER FAULT
- Above V1:  
    - Malfunctions or conditions that give unambiguous indications that the aircraft will not fly safely

## Rejected Takeoff Procedure  

!!! note

      We have modified and condensed the rejected takeoff procedure to enable a single pilot to perform for simulation purposes. In real life operations, the procedures are split between the Captain and FO.

!!! note 

    - Full reverse thrust may be used until coming to a complete stop. But, if there is enough runway available at the end of the deceleration, it is preferable to set thrust levers to idle reverse when passing 70 kts.
    - If the brake response from the autobrake does not seem appropriate for the runway condition, FULL manual braking should be applied and maintained. IF IN DOUBT, TAKE OVER MANUALLY.
