# Discontinuities

## What are Discontinuities?


The flight plan might contain so called discontinuities. These are breaks in the flight plan and often separate two flight plan sections like the SID and first in-route waypoint or the STAR and the APPR. They are also often inserted when the flight plan is modified.

When the aircraft overflies a flight plan discontinuity, the NAV mode automatically reverts to the HDG (TRK) mode. The pilot need to then use DIR TO to fly to the next waypoint.

These discontinuities can be cleared from the flight plan by using the CLR key on the MCDU and selecting the LSK left of the discontinuity.

## Discontinuities After MANUAL Leg

Sometimes discontinuities are also part of a procedure to indicate that manual guidance is required (mostly directed by ATC). The preceding legs are called MANUAL legs.

A MANUAL leg stays on a constant TRK or HDG and has no termination point.

When the aircraft is flying a MANUAL leg, the NAV mode remains engaged and predictions assume that the aircraft will fly a direct leg from its present position to the next waypoint.

The core principle of a MANUAL leg is that air traffic control (ATC)  will give the flight crew headings (vectors) or a direct-to instruction to guide the aircraft to the planned approach path.

If no ATC is available (or when using MSFS ATC) the user must use heading mode (Selected HDG) or direct to (DIR TO) to guide the aircraft to an appropriate intercept course for the approach.
