# After Landing and Taxi to Gate

This guide will explain the correct procedures after we have landed and vacated the runway, and will also cover taxiing to the designated gate.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    The level of detail in this guide is meant to get a Airbus A380 beginner from the runway to the designated destination gate.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner, even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## Prerequisites

Aircraft has vacated the runway completely and has been brought to a stop on the taxiway as per previous chapters.

## Chapters / Phases

This guide will cover these phases:

1. [After Landing](#1-after-landing)
2. [Taxi to Gate](#2-taxi-to-gate)

---

### 1. After Landing

**Situation:**

- Aircraft has vacated the runways completely and has come to a stop on the taxi way as per previous chapters.
- Flaps and Ground Spoilers are still deployed.
- ATC has been informed that we vacated the runway.

!!!info "Simulation vs. Real Life"
    In real life, the A380 will have two pilots who can actually do things in parallel. Talking to ATC, taxiing the aircraft and doing the after landing tasks.

    In the simulation we are typically alone, so it is perfectly fine to stop once we have fully vacated the runway and do these things one after the other.

ATC Tower will usually hand us off to ATC Ground, and they will give us taxi instructions for our destination gate. Write them down and read them back as usual, but you don't have to move immediately unless ATC explicitly tells you to. Online ATC understand that the after-landing- tasks do take some time.

**Immediate steps after vacating the runway:**

- Set your radio frequency to the one assigned by ATC or the airport charts.

- Disarm the `Speed Brake` lever (Ground Spoilers) by pushing down on the lever.

    ![Spoiler armed and disarmed](../assets/beginner-guide/after-landing/Spoiler.png "Spoiler armed and disarmed"){loading=lazy } <p style="color:yellow; font-size:18px;">TODO: update/screenshot</p>

`GROUND SPOILERS ...................................................... OFF`<br/>

- Set your `ENG MODE` selector to NORM in case you set it to IGN/START before.

`ENGINE START SELECTOR ......................................... CHECK NORM`<br/>

- Retract your `FLAPS` to 0.

`FLAPS  ........................................................... RETRACT`<br/>

- Set your `TCAS` to STANDBY.

- Set your `RADAR` and Predictive Windshear System (`PWS`) to OFF.

`WEATHER RADAR ........................................................ OFF`<br/>
`PREDICTIVE WINDSHEAR SYSTEM .......................................... OFF`<br/>

- Start your `APU` by clicking the `APU MASTER SW` button, then the `APU START` button.

`AUXILLIARY POWER UNIT START ........................................... ON`<br/>

- Turn `ANTI ICE` OFF if not required. <p style="color:yellow; font-size:18px;">TODO: update/screenshot</p>

`ANTI-ICE ..................................................... AS REQUIRED`<br/>

- Set your exterior lights:

`LANDING LIGHTS ....................................................... OFF`<br/>
`STROBE .............................................................. AUTO`<br/>
`OTHER EXTERIOR LIGHTS ........................................ AS REQUIRED`<br/>
`NOSE ................................................................ TAXI`<br/>
`RUNWAY TURN OFF LIGHTS ....................................... AS REQUIRED`<br/>

- Turn the brake fan (`BRK FAN`) on if you get a hot brakes ECAM warning.

`BRAKE TEMPERATURE ................................................ MONITOR`<br/>
`BRAKE FAN .................................................... AS REQUIRED`<br/>

- Complete the **After Landing** checklist.

This concludes *After Landing*

### 2. Taxi to Gate

**Situation:**

- Aircraft on taxiway directly after runway.
- **After Landing** checklist is completed.
- ATC Ground has given taxi instructions.

**Taxiing**

Make sure to also read the Taxi section of the [Engine Start and Taxi](04_engine-start-taxi#taxi) chapter.

Use your charts to follow the ATC taxi instructions to the designated gate.

**Crossing a Runway**

When approved to cross a runway (active or not) perform the following actions:

- Look out the windows and visually ensure that there are no visible aircraft to your left and right.
- Turn on extra lights to ensure your aircraft is visible when crossing:
    - Strobe lights - `Set to ON`
- Inform ATC you have vacated the runway if required.

!!! warning
    NEVER cross a runway without express permission from ATC and providing a read back of said instructions. Always ensure maximum safety when crossing.

`ATC CLEARANCE ..................................................... OBTAIN`<br/>
`STROBE LIGHTS ......................................................... ON`<br/>

After you have crossed the runway and are on the adjacent taxiway, turn the strobe lights back off, and notify ATC you are clear of that runway.

`STROBE LIGHTS ........................................................ OFF`<br/>

**Turning into the Gate**

 When turning into the gate, turn off your `NOSE` light and your `RWY TURN OFF` lights to not blind the ground personnel. This of course is only done if enough lighting is available to safely navigate and park into the gate.
