# Overview

Welcome to the A32NX Beginner's Guide. Although this guide is tailored towards beginners, each topic below may even
serve as reminders of proper procedure at different stages of flight for veteran sim pilots.

Each page was reviewed by an A320 type rated pilot and provides accurate information to aircraft operation.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    <p style="color:coral;">This is for simulation purposes only.</p>
    The level of detail in this guide is meant to teach an Airbus A380 beginner to conduct a full flight from gate to 
    gate. 

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation 
    terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner, even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

    This guide simplifies some procedures to accomodate beginners and the fact that this is a simulation. More advanced 
    sim pilots can use the [A380X SOP](../a380x-sop.md) directly for more in depth procedures. 

    When this guide refers to ATC it is referring to any Online ATC network but **NOT** the built-in ATC in the 
    simulator as this is very unrealistic and unreliable. Also using ATC is completely optional and also not recommended
    for beginners. The guide references ATC just to give additional context to the procedures.

!!! info "Airline SOP"
    Please be aware that different airlines may have slightly different procedures at different stages of flight.

The [Preflight](01_preflight.md) page contains guides on how to set up relevant data and configurations before starting
your flight. We recommend starting there.
