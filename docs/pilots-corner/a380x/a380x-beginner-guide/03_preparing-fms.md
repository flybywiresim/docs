# Preparing the Flight Management System

This guide will help you prepare the Flight Management System in the A380X for your departure.
It includes a simple route that you can use to follow along easily and replicate in the simulator.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    <p style="color:coral;">This is for simulation purposes only.</p>

    The level of detail in this guide is meant to teach an Airbus A380 beginner to start the aircraft correctly.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation 
    terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner, even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

    This guide simplifies the process of starting the aircraft to accommodate beginners and the fact that this is a 
    simulation. More advanced sim pilots can use the [A380X SOP](../a380x-sop.md) directly. 

    When this guide refers to ATC it is referring to any Online ATC network but **NOT** the built-in ATC in the 
    simulator as this is very unrealistic and unreliable.

The simBrief route used in this guide:

!!! tip "AIRAC Updates"
    Please note, we may update this OFP and guide occasionally to ensure it is current with the latest AIRAC
    provided by the simulator or external nav-data.

## Prerequisites

Below are a few Prerequisites before starting programming the FMS.

Visit [Cockpit Preparation](02_cockpit-preparation.md) to learn more.

* Make sure the aircraft is powered up.
  * External Power OR APU
* Make sure the ADIRS are set to NAV.
* Have a valid flight plan.
* Ensure IFR clearance has been obtained.

## Chapters / Phases

This guide will cover the following topics in helping you set up the FMS:

* [Understanding the FMS](#understanding-the-fms)
    * [Using Keyboard and Mouse](#using-keyboard-and-mouse)
* [FMS Initialization](#fms-initialization)
    * [Data & Status](#data--status)
    * [Init & Flight Plan Initialization](#init--flight-plan-initialization)
    * [Navaids](#navaids)
    * [Fuel & Payload](#fuel--payload)
    * [Performance](#performance)
* [A380X simBrief Integration](#a380x-simbrief-integration)

## Understanding the FMS

During this guide we will be referring to a few key terms which are defined below.

### Using Keyboard and Mouse

The FMS can be managed entirely using your mouse and keyboard, allowing for a greater freedom and efficiency when 
selecting items and entering information.

Below is a screenshot of the FMS as you would find it after the initial start up of the aircraft. Two items are 
highlighted in the image below:

* Buttons show up as grey boxes.
  * If a button has a downwards pointing triangle, it indicates a dropdown menu.
  * If a button has greyed out text, it is disabled.
  * Tabs also show as buttons.
* The mouse pointer is identified as a yellow `X` with a dot in the middle.

Highlighted and selected buttons and fields will have a blue border around them.

![FMS STATUS PAGE](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-status-elements.png){loading=lazy}

By using the mouse and using the different dropdown menus and buttons, it is easy to navigate through the entire FMS and 
quickly find the page or information you are looking for.

When you select an input field, you will be able to use your regular keyboard to type in the expected data. By pressing 
`ENTER`, you will confirm the entry in the field.

## FMS Initialization

### Data & Status

When the FMS first starts, it will show a screen showing the current status of the aircraft. This information includes:

* Aircraft type
* Engine type
* Navigation Database serial number and dates
* Pilot stored Waypoints, Routes, Navaids and Runways

<!-- TODO: Include description of the DATA menu and the available and currently unavailable options -->

### Init & Flight Plan Initialization

??? tip "What and Why?"
    The FMS contains information about the flight that needs to be set up by the pilots. This includes:

    * Flight Number
    * From, To and possible Alternate airports
    * Cruise level
    * Cost Index
    * Flight Plan Route
 
    These form the basis of the FMS Initialization and help the FMS manage the flight. It helps program the different 
    systems in the aircraft to optimally fly the flightplan.

`FLIGHT PLAN INITIALIZATION........................................COMPLETE`<br/>

??? tip "Step 1 - FMS Initialization"
    The Flight Plan Initialization starts by opening the `INIT` page on the FMS from the `ACTIVE` menu.

    #### Flight Number

    ![FMS FLT NBR](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-init-flt-nbr.png){loading=lazy}

    * Click the `FLT NBR` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type the flight number you want to use (e.g. "FBW388") and press the `ENTER` key.

    This will confirm the flight number in the FMS. It can be used to identify your flight.

    #### From, To and Alternate Airports^^

    * Click the `FROM` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `EDDM` and press the `ENTER` key.
    * Click the `TO` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `EDDF` and press the `ENTER` key.
    * (Optionally) Click the `ALTN` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * (Optionally) Using your keyboard, type `EDDL` and press the `ENTER` key.

    This will set up the FMS for a flight from Munich to Frankfurt with the alternate airport set to Duesseldorf. 

    #### Cost Index
    
    ![OFP CI](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/ofp-ci.png){loading=lazy}

    The Cost Index helps the FMS determine the balance between fuel consumption and flight duration. This is used by 
    airlines to balance the fuel-related costs versus the time-related costs of a flight. A high Cost Index indicates 
    that time efficiency is more important. A low Cost Index indicates that fuel efficiency is more important.

    The Cost Index can be found in the OFP as highlighted in the image.

    * Click the `CI` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `10` and press the `ENTER` key.

    #### Cruise Level & Temp

    ![OFP CRZ FL](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/ofp-crz-fl.png){loading=lazy}

    The Cruise Level of the flight can be found on the OFP as highlighted in the image. It is listed as `0240` 
    indicating `FL240`. 

    * Click the `CRZ FL` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `240` and press the `ENTER` key.
    
    The `CRZ TEMP` field will automatically update.

    !!! warning "`CRZ TEMP` availability"
        The `CRZ TEMP` is not fully implemented yet and might not automatically be set.

??? tip "Step 2 - Flight Plan Entry"
    Our route for this flight can be found on the 2nd page of the OFP

    !!! info "Routing Disclaimer"
        Note that waypoints, STARs, and SIDs may be called differently due to different nav-databases or different AIRAC 
        cycles between simBrief and the simulator.

    ![OFP ROUTING](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/ofp-routing.png){loading=lazy}

    #### Inputting a SID

    !!! info "Standard Instrument Departure (SID)"
        These are procedures that are defined and published that take a flight from the take-off phase to the en route 
        phase.

        Also see: [SIDS and STARS](../../airliner/airliner-flying-guide/navigation.md#sids-and-stars)

    Now that the FMS has been initialized with the basic information of the flight, it is time to add the Flight Plan. 
    This starts with clicking the `DEPARTURE` button on the `INIT` page.

    ![INIT DEPARTURE](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-init-departure.png){loading=lazy}

    This will open the `F-PLN/DEPARTURE` page, from where you can select the Standard Instrument Departure (SID). 

    * Click the `RUNWAY` dropdown and select `08L 4000M ILS`.
    * Click the `SID` dropdown and scroll down until you can select `GIVM6Q`. 

    For this SID, there is no Transition (`TRANS`) waypoint, so the dropdown will remain gray. 

    ![INIT DEPARTURE ENTERED](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-init-departure-entered.png){loading=lazy}

    Now you can click the `TMPY F-PLN`, which will enter the SID information in the Temporary Flight Plan in the FMS. A 
    Temporary Flight Plan will show in yellow text to indicate it isn't active yet.
    
    You can use the arrow keys at the bottom of the screen to scroll through the current Flight Plan. The SID terminates 
    at `GIVMI` and this is where we can begin to fill out the rest of the flight plan.

    #### En Route Flight Plan

    ![TMPY FPLN WAYPOINT MENU](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-tmpy-fpln-waypoint-menu.png){loading=lazy}

    Our flight plan uses Airways between waypoints to simplify the routing by using standard defined routes in the 
    airspace. It also makes it easier to enter the En route portion of the flight plan.

    * Click the `GIVMI` waypoint.
    * From the menu that opens, select `AIRWAYS`.
    * Click the `VIA` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `Y101` *(the airway)* and press the `ENTER` key.
    * Click the `TO` field so a blue typing cursor appears in the field.
    * Using your keyboard, type `ERNAS` *(the waypoint)* and press the `ENTER` key.
    * A second line with a new `VIA` and `TO` field will appear. Use these to follow the same procedure to enter `T161` 
      as the airway and `DEBHI` as the waypoint.

    ![TMPY FPLN AIRWAYS](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-tmpy-fpln-airways.png){loading=lazy}

    * Click the `TMPY F-PLN` button to load this into your Temporary Flight Plan.

    ??? info "DCT Before a Waypoint"
        There will be cases where your flight plan has waypoints and no airways, or a mix of both. When you go direct 
        from one waypoint to another, it will usually look like the following: `WAYPOINT DCT WAYPOINT`. You might also 
        see directs represented as two waypoints without a separator, which looks like `WAYPOINT WAYPOINT`.
    
        Let's look at an example and understand how to program these into the FMS. (*Please note this is not applicable 
        to the sample flight plan in this guide, and we plan to create a more advanced flight plan entry guide at a 
        later time.*)
    
        Below is the current flight plan we are utilizing:
    
        ```title="Current Sample Flight Plan"
        EDDM/08L GIVMI6Q GIVMI Y101 ERNAS T161 DEBHI DEBHI1C EDDF/07C
        ```
    
        Let's imagine for this example that there was no airway between `GIVMI` and `ERNAS`, as well as between `ERNAS` 
        and `DEBHI`. The flight plan would look like the following:
    
        ```title="Example NO AIRWAY Flight Plan"
        EDDM/08L GIVMI6Q GIVMI DCT ERNAS DCT DEBHI DEBHI1C EDDF/07C
        ```
    
        !!! note ""
            The airways `Y101` and `T161` were replaced with `DCT` indicating from waypoint `GIVMI` proceed direct to 
            `ERNAS` and after that proceed direct to `DEBHI`.
    
        When you encounter this type of routing, there are a couple of ways to input this leg without the use of the 
        airways page on the FMS.
    
        One of the easiest ways is utilizing the `INSERT NEXT WPT` option in the menu when clicking a waypoint in the 
        flight plan. To do this, simply find the starting waypoint on your F-PLN page, which in this case is `GIVMI`.
    
        * Click the `GIVMI` waypoint.
        * From the menu that opens, select `INSERT NEXT WPT`. You will see the following:
        * Click the dropdown field so a blue typing cursors appears in the field (do not select from the dropdown).
        * Using your keyboard, type `ERNAS` and press the `ENTER` key.
        
        ![TMPY FPLN NEXT WPT](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-tmpy-fpln-next-wpt.png){loading=lazy width=50%}
    
    #### Planning the Arrival
    
    For the purposes of this guide, we will pre-plan our arrival into `EDDF` via the `DEBHI1C` STAR into 07C.
    
    !!! info "Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)"
        Similar to the SID, these are procedures that are defined and published that take a flight from
        the last point in a route *(in our case `DEBHI`)* to the first point in the approach or the initial approach fix 
        (IAF).
    
        Also see: [SIDS and STARS](../../airliner/airliner-flying-guide/navigation.md#sids-and-stars)
    
    Find the `EDDF` button at the bottom left of the Temporary Flight Plan. This will open the `F-PLN/ARRIVAL` page, 
    from where you can select the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR).

    * Click the `RUNWAY` dropdown and select `07C 4000M`
    * Click the `APPR` dropdown and select `ILS07C-Z`
    ??? note "Y or Z Designators"
        A designator such as Y or Z may be present. This suffix is to distinguish in the navigation database a 
        difference between approaches to the same runway. While similar in nature, they may have different minimums, 
        allowed equipment, or other differences.

    * Click the `VIA` dropdown and select `DF554`
    * Click the `STAR` dropdown and select `DEBH1C`

    For this STAR, there is no Transition (`TRANS`) waypoint, so the dropdown will remain gray. 

    ![TMPY FPLN ARRIVAL ENTERED](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-tmpy-fpln-arrival-entered.png){loading=lazy}

    Now you can click the `TMPY F-PLN`, which will enter the STAR information in the Temporary Flight Plan in the FMS.     

    #### Verify the Flight Plan

    Verify the flight plan by scrolling through it and check all the waypoints. 

    !!! info "Viewing Flight Plan on ND"
        We can also verify the route looks correct by selecting `Plan` on the EFIS control panel and watching the ND as 
        we scroll through. When doing so for a Temporary Flight Plan, the lines between waypoints will be dashed and 
        yellow. The active flight plan will show as green solid lines.

    ??? info "MANUAL Leg and DISCONTINUITY"
        The flight plan might contain so-called discontinuities. These are breaks in the flight plan and often separate 
        two flight plan sections, like the SID and first in-route waypoint or the STAR and the APPR. They are also often 
        inserted when the flight plan is modified.

        Sometimes discontinuities are also part of a procedure to indicate that manual input is required
        (mostly clearance by ATC). The preceding legs are called MANUAL legs. 
    
        **Discontinuities after a MANUAL leg can not and should not be deleted. See below link on how to 
        handle discontinuities.** 
    
        In this flight plan we have a discontinuity between the STAR and approach procedure as shown below.

        ![TMPY FPLN DISCONTINUITY](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-tmpy-fpln-discontinuity.png){loading=lazy}

        See our detailed documentation for 
        [Discontinuities](../../a32nx/a32nx-advanced-guides/flight-planning/disco.md){target=new} to understand how to 
        appropriately handle these when encountered on your F-PLN page. 
    
        !!! warning ""
            Additionally, make note of this 
            [Special Case](../../a32nx/a32nx-advanced-guides/flight-planning/disco.md#special-case) on the discontinuity 
            page.

    After verifying the flight plan, you can use the `INSERT TMPY *` button on the bottom right of the `F-PLN` page. 
    This will insert the Temporary Flight Plan into the Active Flight Plan.

### Navaids

??? tip "What and Why?"
    The Navaids are used to tune the different radio navigation frequencies. This includes VOR and ILS frequencies.

    * A VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) is a radio beacon that can be used for non-precision navigation. 
      These beacons are used to follow or verify the route flown.
    * ILS (Instrument Landing System) is a radio navigation system that provides short-range guidance to aircraft for 
      landing on a runway.

    Both can be entered using frequencies or identifiers for ease of use. 

    The A380X supports VOR and ILS auto-tuning when in range of a VOR before departure. We will verify this in the "How 
    and Where?" step below. For ILS auto-tuning, the FMS will automatically load the departure runway ILS frequency if 
    there is one. Once we get within 250NM of our destination and are in climb phase or later, the ILS frequency of the 
    selected arrival runway will be auto-tuned.

`NAVAIDS..............................................................CHECK`<br/>

??? tip "How and Where?"
    To reach the Navaids page, go back to the `INIT` page. You can do so by either selecting `INIT` from the `ACTIVE` 
    dropdown, or if you are on the `F-PLN` page after the previous section, you can just click the `INIT` button on the 
    bottom of the `F-PLN` page. 

    Once on the `INIT` page, you can click the `NAVAIDS` button to go to the Navaids page.

    On this page, we would set any frequencies or identifiers needed for the departure and subsequently later en route, 
    those required for the arrival.

    #### VOR Tuning

    The A380X supports VOR auto-tuning when in range of a VOR before departure. You can verify this by checking the 
    RADNAV page and seeing if the VOR frequency is already populated. You should verify the relevance of this VOR to 
    your departure procedure and flight plan before takeoff.

    On this departure SID, we have routing instructions that rely on the Munich VOR `DMN` with a frequency of `116.0`.

    To enter this, you can click the `IDENT` field for `VOR1` and enter `DMN` and press `ENTER`. A page will open 
    showing multiple options. Select the closest one, with the `116.0` frequency. Now you have the `DMN` VOR selected 
    and can use it as a reference on the ND.

    #### Departure ILS

    When selecting the SID earlier in the flight plan section, the A380X should have auto-populated the ILS/LOC 
    frequency under the `LS` heading. If it hasn't, we can manually insert it for centerline guidance on take off.

    Our departure runway is EDDM/08L (runway 08 left), which has a frequency of `109.50`. When inputting a frequency, 
    and we are in range of the ILS, it will auto-populate the identifier and course. You could also enter the identifier 
    `IMNE` and it would automatically fill in the frequency.

    If the ILS information was not automatically populated, you can select the `IDENT` field under the `LS` header and 
    type in `IMNE` and then press `ENTER`. The other fields will automatically get populated.

    #### Arrival ILS

    With an ILS or LOC approach selected, the arrival ILS frequency should be automatically tuned correctly whenever the 
    aircraft is in climb phase or greater and within 250 NM of the destination. Ensure that we verify the ILS frequency 
    when we reach the arrival phase of the flight - see [Landing](07_landing.md#during-instrument-approach).

    ![NAVAIDS](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-navaids.png){loading=lazy}

### Fuel & Payload

??? tip "What and Why?"
    For a safe flight, we need to make sure that the FMS has the correct information about the fuel and payload on 
    board. This section will go over configuring the different values the FMS will use for optimal flight planning:

    * **Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW)** is the weight of the aircraft including passengers, cargo, and crew, but excluding 
      usable fuel.
    * **Zero Fuel Weight Center of Gravity (ZFWCG)** represents the aircraft's balance point without fuel, affecting 
      stability and control during flight.
    * **Block Fuel (BLOCK)** is the total amount of fuel loaded before departure, covering the entire flight, reserves, 
      and taxiing.
    * **Route Reserve Fuel (RTE RSV)** is additional fuel allocated for potential deviations along your planned route, 
      such as detours due to weather or air traffic control instructions.
    * **Alternate Fuel (ALTN)** is the fuel required to fly from your destination airport to the alternate airport if 
      landing at the original destination isn't possible.
    * **Final Reserve Fuel (FINAL)** is the mandatory minimum fuel reserve upon reaching the alternate airport, 
      typically enough for 30 minutes of holding at a specified altitude. This is also referred to as **FINRES**.
    * **Passengers (PAX)** is the amount of passengers aboard.


    !!! info "Loading Fuel"
        Via the EFB - [Learn How](../../../aircraft/common/flypados3/ground.md#fuel-page)

`ZFW/ZFWCG...........................................................INSERT`<br/>
`BLOCK FUEL..........................................................INSERT`<br/>
`RTE RSV/FINAL..................................CHECK/INSERT AS APPROPRIATE`<br/>
`MIN FUEL AT DEST...............................CHECK/INSERT AS APPROPRIATE`<br/>

??? tip "How and Where?"
    Return to the `INIT` page on the FMS and select the `FUEL&LOAD` button to open the `FUEL&LOAD` page where we will fill in the different values for `ZFW`, `ZFWCG`, `BLOCK`, `TAXI`, `PAX NBR`, `ALTN` and `FINAL`.

    Before we can fill in the values though, we need to find the correct values. Each of these can be found in several 
    locations, below is a description for the most common locations in the EFB or OFP.

    ^^ZFW, BLOCK, ALTN and FINAL/FINRES^^

    These values can be found in the OFP as shown below. Note that ZFW can also be found on the EFB once passengers 
    start boarding. 

    ![OFP FUEL VALUES](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/ofp-zfw-altn-finres-block.png){loading=lazy}

    ^^ZFW, ZFWCG and PAX^^

    Once boarding has started with the appropriate number of passengers set in the EFB, using the payload window, you 
    can find the ZFW, ZFWCG and PAX as highlighted below.

    ![EFB PAYLOAD PAGE](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/efb-payload-zfw-zfwcg.png){loading=lazy}

    You can also find the passenger numbers in the OFP as well in the WEIGHTS section on the third page.

    ![EFB WEIGHTS](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/ofp-pax.png){loading=lazy}

    ---

    Now that we have all the necessary values, we can go to each of the different fields and set the correct values. 
    It's important to indicate that in the OFP or EFB, the values are set in Kilograms (KG), where the FMS expects them 
    in Tons (1000 KG). We need to divide the values from the OFP and EFB by a 1000 and round them to one decimal.

    Some of the values might already have some information set, but it is good to verify they are correct, and if not, 
    enter the correct ones.

    * Click on in the input box next to `ZFW` to fill in the value of `341.5` and press `ENTER` to store the value.
    * For the `ZFWCG`, we do the same and enter `35.1`.
    * Next is the `BLOCK` value, where we fill in the block fuel value of `22.6`. 
    * For `TAXI`, we set the value to `1.0`.
    * `PAX NBR` we set to `399`.
    * The `CI` should already be set to `10`, but it's good to verify.
    * `RTE RSV` is grayed out and can not be configured at this time, this is expected. As long as `BLOCK` is correctly 
      filled in, the FMS will take all fuel on board in account.
    * For the `ALTN` value, we set `5.9`.
    * Finally, check the `FINAL` value, it should be close to what is in the OFP, if not, fill in the correct value as 
      described in the OFP. This might slightly change the time indication for your final reserve.

    Once you have filled in all the information in the `FUEL&LOAD` page, the page should look similar to the one below.

    ![FMS FUEL AND LOAD](../assets/beginner-guide/03_preparing-fms/fms-fuel-load.png){loading=lazy}

### Performance

??? tip "What and Why?"
    The `PERF` page in holds information about the performance configuration of the aircraft for every phase of the 
    flight, starting with the Take Off phase.

    The `T.O PERF` (Takeoff Performance) page in the FMS allows pilots to input and verify takeoff-related data to 
    optimize aircraft performance during departure. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the aircraft operates within 
    safe performance limits by accounting for current conditions such as aircraft weight, runway length, environmental
    factors, and configuration settings.

    On the `T.O PERF` page, pilots enter or confirm settings like takeoff flaps and slats positions, engine thrust mode 
    (more details below), and any changes in available runway length (`T.O SHIFT`). Additionally, it also requires 
    setting the essential speeds:

    * **V1**: Decision speed where a takeoff should no longer be aborted.
    * **VR**: Rotation speed at which the pilot begins to lift the nose for takeoff.
    * **V2**: Takeoff safety speed that ensures sufficient climb performance.
    
    The page may also include settings for acceleration altitude and engine-out acceleration altitude, which are 
    important for climb performance and obstacle clearance. By accurately configuring the `T.O PERF` page, pilots ensure 
    that the aircraft's automation systems are properly programmed for the takeoff phase, enhancing safety and 
    efficiency.

    ^^TOGA, FLEX and DERATED^^

    The choice among TOGA, FLEX, and DERATED depends on factors like runway length, aircraft weight, and environmental 
    conditions.

    * TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) thrust provides maximum engine power for takeoff and is used when maximum performance is 
      required, such as on short runways or in adverse conditions. 
    * FLEX thrust is a reduced power setting based on an assumed higher temperature, allowing for lower engine stress 
      and fuel savings; it's used when full thrust isn't necessary due to favorable conditions. 
    * DERATED takeoff further reduces engine thrust by selecting a lower fixed thrust setting, independent of 
      temperature assumptions. This minimizes engine wear and extends its lifespan.

    !!! warning "DERATED is not yet supported for the A380X."

    For this guide, we will use FLEX thrust.

    To fill in the `T.O PERF` page, we will need to calculate the appropriate values. We will use the 
    [Simbrief Takeoff Performance Calculater](https://dispatch.simbrief.com/tools/search?performance=takeoff){target=new}. 
    By selecting the proper configuration, we can get good estimations of values that will work.

    Using the calculator, we need to fill in several fields:

    * Select the correct Aircraft Type (A388 - A380-800) and the correct Variant (D8-FBW - FLYBYWIRE A380X). 
    * Enter the Airport as `EDDM` and select Runway `08L`.
    * Enter the Takeoff Weight as `363068`, this can be found on the `FUEL&LAD` page after entering all the correct 
      values under `TOW`. A more accurate value can be found on the OFP.

    * Select the Flap Setting as `2`, this will more efficient on the take off and lower our speeds.
    * Select `TOGA/FLEX` for the Thrust Setting.
    * For the other values, it is you can keep them as Simbrief populates them. It is good to select "Populate Weather" 
      to get the current weather at the airport to get accurate data for when you are flying.

    After all values have been entered, press the Calculate button, and the Takeoff Performance panel on the right 
    should show the calculated values.

    ^^THS Value^^

    You can find the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer Nose Forward (THS FOR) value on the PFD in the magenta box. Make 
    sure all loading (passengers, luggage and fuel) has finished to get an accurate reading.

    #### Take Off Performance

    To enter these values, we need to go to the `T.O PERF` page by clicking the `T.O PERF` page on the `INIT` page in 
    the FMS. Once the page opens, enter the calculated values from the Simbrief Takeoff Performance calculator (the 
    values calculated for your flight might differ because of different weather situations):

    * Set the `V1` speed to `136`.
    * Set the `VR` speed to `136`. 
    * Set the `V2` speed to `142`.
    * Select `FLEX` and fill in `66` for the temperature.
    * Select `2` for `FLAPS`.
    * Set `THS FOR` value to `36.0`
    * Set `PACKS` to `ON` and `ANTI ICE` to `ENG ONLY` (or as per what the Performance calculator suggests).
    * The `THR RED`, `ACCEL` and `EO ACCEL` altitudes will be set automatically to appropriate values.
    * The `TRANS` Altitude (transition altitude) can be found on the chart for our SID, in case of the `GIVMI6Q` SID, 
      the transition altitude is `5000`.

    Once you filled in all fields, your `T.O PERF` page should look similar to the image below.
