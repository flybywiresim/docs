## Usage

### WING anti-ice

- OFF:
    - Wing anti-ice is off.
- ON:
    - Wing anti-ice is on.
    - The ECAM displays the WING A-ICE memo.
    - On ground, the wing anti-ice valves will open for 30s. Wing anti-ice will then be
      inhibited for 10 min, provided the aircraft is not in flight. If the flight crew does not
      switch off the wing anti-ice, the ON light will remain on, even though the wing anti-ice
      valves are closed. The wing anti-ice valves will then reopen after takeoff thrust
      reduction.
- FAULT:
    - The wing anti-ice valve position disagrees with the requested position
    - Or, the wing anti-ice valve is open, but a low pressure is detected.
    - Amber light and ECAM caution message.
    - The FAULT light goes off, when the affected wing anti-ice system is recovered, after
      applying the appropriate procedure.
    - If the system cannot be recovered, the FAULT light will
      remain on for the remainder of the flight.
