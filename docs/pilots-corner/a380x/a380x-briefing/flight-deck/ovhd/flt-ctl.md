## Description

The flight control system is a fly-by-wire system.

All the flight control surfaces are:

- Electrically controlled,
- Hydraulically actuated.<br/>
  The surfaces are actuated by one of the two hydraulic systems, or by an independent hydraulic
  source (EHA/EBHA).<br/>
  Note: The slats also have an electrical motor.

The flight crew uses sidesticks and rudder pedals to fly the aircraft. The flight control computers
interpret the pilot's inputs, and order flight control surface movement, as necessary.
Additionally, a pitch trim switch and a rudder trim selector (with a rudder trim reset p/b) allow to trim the
airplane when needed.
