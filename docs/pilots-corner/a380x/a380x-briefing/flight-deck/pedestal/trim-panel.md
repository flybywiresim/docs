## Pitch Trim

This control is used to adjust the aircraft's nose attitude up or down. It changes the angle of the
horizontal stabilizer on the tail to reduce control forces on the stick or yoke for the pilot. The actual adjustment is
made by moving the switch up to trim the nose down or down to trim the nose up.

On ground, or in direct law, the THS is directly controlled via the pitch trim switch.
In flight, in normal and alternate law, the THS is controlled by the flight control computers.

## Rudder Trim

This is used to adjust the aircraft's yaw to keep it flying straight with minimal control input,
especially useful when the aircraft experiences asymmetrical forces like engine failure or crosswinds. The rudder
trim is controlled by moving the knob left to turn the nose left (L) or right to turn the nose right (R).

## Rudder Trim Display 

This display shows the current rudder trim setting in degrees. 

## Reset Button

Typically, this button is used to reset the rudder trim settings to a neutral  position.
