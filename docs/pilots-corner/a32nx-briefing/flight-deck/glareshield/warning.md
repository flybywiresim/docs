## Usage

### 1. SIDE STICK PRIORITY

- Red arrow light:
    - Illuminates in front of the pilot who is losing authority.
    - Light extinguishes if the pilot has recovered authority.
        - If the pilot either:
            - Releases his TAKEOVER pb before the priority condition is set
            - Used the TAKEOVER pb to cancel a set priority situation.<br/>
         **Sidestick priority audio**: The audio voice message "PRIORITY LEFT" or "PRIORITY RIGHT" is played each time priority is taken.

- Green CAPT and F/O lights:
    - Both lights will flash if the pilots are attempting to move both sidesticks at the same time and neither pilot takes priority.
    - If a pilot who has taken priority by using the TAKEOVER pb and the other pilot's sidestick is in motion or not neutral, the light of the pilot who has taken priority illuminates. It will extinguish when the opposing sidestick returns to the neutral position.
