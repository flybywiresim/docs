## Description

The Overhead Aft Panel contains the Emergency Circuit Breaker Panel.

The aircraft has two types of Circuit Breakers (C/Bs):

- Monitored (green): When out for more than one minute, the C/B TRIPPED warning is triggered on the ECAM.
- Non-monitored (black).

The C/B TRIPPED warning on the ECAM points to the location of the affected C/B. These panels are monitored: OVHD PNL, L(R) ELEC BAY, REAR PNL J-M or N-R or S-V or W-Z.

Note: The CLR or the EMER CANCEL pushbutton can be used to clear the ECAM caution. If the EMER CANCEL is used, and if a second C/B is tripped on the same panel, the corresponding C/B TRIPPED caution will not be triggered.

The Overhead Aft Panel is usually not used during flight.
