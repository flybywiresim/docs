## Description

The Emergency Locator Transmitter is mounted in the back of the aircraft, and is designed to be triggered upon impact or may be manually activated using the remote switch and control panel indicator in the cockpit.

An audio alert starts and a distress signal is transmitted for search and rescue upon activation. The distress signal is only audible when the correct frequency (in this case 121.500) is selected in the RMP (and the corresponding reception knobs of the ACP are set accordingly).

An additional handheld ELT is usually mounted in the cockpit wardrobe.
