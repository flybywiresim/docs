![dir-to-page.jpg](../../assets/a32nx-briefing/mcdu/dir-to-page.jpg)

## Description

The DIR TO page is used by the flight crew to select waypoints from the flight plan or to enter new waypoints to modify the current active flight plan by creating a direct leg to the selected/entered waypoint.

When in NAV mode this changes the currently active leg and waypoint. In HDG mode activation of a DIR TO will switch to NAV mode for a direct course to the new waypoint.
