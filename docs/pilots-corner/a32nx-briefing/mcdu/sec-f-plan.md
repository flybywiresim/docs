The SEC F-PLN key on the MCDU console allows the flight crew to call up the secondary index page
and the secondary flight plan page. The secondary flight plan is generally used to prepare a diversion
an alternate routing, for predictable runway changes at takeoff or landing, or for a next flight.
There are two types of secondary index page, depending on whether a secondary flight plan has
already been defined.
