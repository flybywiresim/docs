# Preflight

Before you start your flight in earnest, we have included various features in the A32NX that assist in configuring the aircraft and in-flight support. Some of these feature require the aircraft to be powered on and will be noted below. Additionally, these guides will be linked in the appropriate locations throughout the beginner guide.

## Flight Planning

We highly recommend **not** using the built-in MSFS flight planner. SimBrief is a great resources that provides routing and other information to successfully plan your flight. You can choose to use other software/websites to plan your route but when using simBrief we have a handy import feature as seen in the next section.

    See our [Custom Flight Management System](../../fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS.md) page and the special notes when using our development version of the aircraft.

## Flight Plan Import

If you wish to expedite the process of inputting your flight plan on the MCDU we have incorporated a simBrief import function on the MCDU. Our EFB can also display your generated OFP within MSFS.
