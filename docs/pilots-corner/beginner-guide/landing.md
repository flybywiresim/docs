# Approach and ILS Landing

This guide will explain the correct procedures to fly a final approach and conduct an ILS landing.


!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    The level of detail in this guide is meant to get a FlyByWire A320neo beginner currently on approach to intercept the ILS and land the aircraft safely on the runway.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner, even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

    You will also find many great videos on YouTube on how to land the FlyByWire A32NX.<br/>

## Prerequisites

The aircraft is on approach shortly before intercepting the ILS and is still in phase and state `DES` as per previous chapters.

## 1. Intercepting the ILS Localizer

**Situation:**

- Aircraft is in `DES` phase.
- Aircraft is set up for flight < 10 000 ft (`seat belt signs` on, `landing lights` on, etc.).
- We are within the IAP (Instrument Approach) and either:
    - at the altitude and speed from the chart (Final Approach Fix altitude and 250 knots if there are no other speed restrictions on the chart).
    - or we are at a heading vector, altitude, and speed instructed by ATC.

At the end of the Instrument Approach, (or by ATC vectoring) we will be on a path to the Final Approach Fix and/or a path to intercept the ILS localizer and eventually the ILS glideslope.

As a last instruction from ATC Approach we are usually instructed to contact Tower ATC when fully established on the ILS localizer.

To intercept the ILS Localizer, we follow these steps:

- Verify that the correct ILS frequency is tuned in the `MCDU-RNAV` page. We find the correct frequency on the approach chart.<br/>

    === "Check ILS frequency"

        ![ILS frequency on approach chart](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/EDDM-26R-ILS-freq-chart.png "ILS frequency on approach chart"){align=left width=45%}
        
        ![ILS frequency on ECAM RNAV page](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/ECAM-RNAV-page-ILS.png "ILS frequency on ECAM RNAV page"){align=right width=45%}


- Turn on the `ILS localizer and glideslope scales` with the `LS` button on the glareshield if not already done before.

    === "Turn on ILS scales"
        ![LS button on glareshield](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/GLARE-LS-button.png "LS button on glareshield"){loading=lazy align=left}
        ![LS Mode on PFD and ND](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/LS-Mode.png "LS Mode on PFD and ND"){align=right width=75%}

- Make sure we are on the correct altitude (5000 ft in this example) and we should not have an approach angle larger than 30°.<br/>

    ![EDDM glideslope](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/EDDM-ILS-26R-GS-chart.png "EDDM glideslope"){loading=lazy}

- Optional: Turn on `ROSE LS Mode` for the `ND` (can also be on F.O.'s side). The ROSE LS Mode shows the deviation from the localizer approach heading path.

    ![ND ROSE LS Mode](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/ND-ROSE-LS-Mode.png "ND ROSE LS Mode"){loading=lazy}

- Activate the `APPR` phase in the `MCDU-PERF` page. This is usually automatically done by the aircraft at a certain point during the approach, but we make sure that at this point at the latest it is activated. In `APPR` phase, the `Autopilot` together with "Managed Speed Mode" relieves the pilot of a lot of stress by managing the speed according to flaps setting automatically (S-Speed after `FLAPS 1`, F-Speed after `FLAPS 2`, V~app~ after landing flap selection).

    ![Activate APPR in ECAM PERF](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/ECAM-PERF-activate-APPR.png "Activate APPR in ECAM PERF"){loading=lazy }

- Set `SPEED` to `Managed Speed Mode` (push the `Speed Selector`). The aircraft should now decelerate to `green dot` speed.
- Set `FLAPS` to 1 at about V~FE~ -15 knots (but never before speed is below V~FE~) for the first slat/flap configuration (`CONF1`). The aircraft will then decelerate further to prepare for the next flaps configuration. Our target is to be in CONF 1 and at S-speed by the time you need to set flaps 2 (CONFIG 2) before the glideslope intercept (S-speed will be slow enough to set flaps 2).

    ![VFE for next configuration](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-Speed-band-flaps-marker.png "VFE for next configuration"){loading=lazy}

- Turn on `APPR` in the `FCU` to command the aircraft to intercept the ILS localizer. The aircraft will keep the current heading until the localizer is captured and guides the aircraft towards the runway. The `lateral ILS localizer scale` shows the `deviation marker` moving towards the middle of the `lateral deviation scale`. Also, the lateral `FMA` shows `LOC` in blue (armed). Usually AP2 is turned on at this point to have a redundancy on the approach, for the sake of this guide you can leave it off.

    ![Activate APPR mode on FCU](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/FCU-ILS-APPR.png "Activate APPR mode on FCU"){loading=lazy}

    ![ILS lateral deviation marker moving inwards](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-ILS-deviation-scale.png "ILS lateral deviation marker moving inwards"){loading=lazy}

??? note "What is the blue-dashed line?"
    You might ask what the blue dashed line is. It is part of the FIX INFO feature which allows drawing distance rings or radial lines from navigation fixes. For this illustration, it helps us to visualize the localizer signal path at 261° into the runway, which we are going to capture with the APPR mode.

!!! warning "Arming APPR"
    Using `APPR` also arms the glideslope descent (G/S) and the aircraft will descend as soon as it captures the ILS glideslope signal.
    Do not descend without ATC clearance and only when directly on the ILS localizer path as only as obstacle clearance is guaranteed.
    To help with this you can use the `LOC` button first (only localizer capture) and when cleared for approach press `APPR`

- When we are established on the ILS localizer (the lateral `FMA` shows `LOC` in green) we will contact Tower ATC and report that we are established on the ILS localizer (including call sign and runway).

    ![Established on ILS localizer](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-ND-established.png "Established on ILS localizer"){loading=lazy}

Tower ATC will then give us clearance for the ILS approach to the target runway. This clears us to descend on the ILS glideslope.

**Do not descend without explicit clearance from ATC.**

This concludes *Intercepting the ILS Localizer*

---

## 2. Intercepting the ILS Glideslope

**Situation:**

- Aircraft is in `APPR` phase
- Aircraft is established on ILS localizer
- Configuration is `CONF1` at S-Speed (`FLAPS 1`)

After ATC has given us clearance for the ILS approach, we can also start descending using the ILS glideslope.


Check that the `APPR` button is activated on the `FCU` to arm the ILS glideslope descent mode.

The vertical `FMA` now shows `G/S` (glideslope) in blue.

![PFD glideslope deviation marker](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-ILS-glideslope.png "PFD glideslope deviation marker"){loading=lazy }

 This is a good time to set `Flaps 2` (check that the speed is below the V~FE~ for the next flap setting) as slowing down once we are descending along the glideslope can be difficult. We need the drag from the flaps if we want to avoid letting the gear down too early (which also would help us to slow down).<br/>

!!! info ""
    There is different guidance when to set `FLAPS 2` at different airlines or Airbus. But for beginners, we recommend going to `FLAPS 2` before starting the glideslope descent. Airbus guidance, for example, is `FLAPS 2` during glideslope descent at about 2000 ft, which only works if speed is already reduced enough.

!!! info "ATC instructed approach speed"
    The A320 `Autothrust` will manage speed during approach automatically and will reduce speed further with each flap setting. In real life and also when flying with Online ATC like VATSIM, we need to expect that ATC instructs us to stay at a certain speed (e.g., 160 knots until 5 NM to the runway). In this case, we would use `Selected Speed Mode` (select a speed in the `FCU` and pull the knob) until the instructed distance to the runway where we would then go back to `Managed Speed Mode` and drop the gear then as well as setting flaps to 3 and flaps to full - see below.

The aircraft will start descending when the deviation marker is in the middle (we have captured the ILS glideslope). The vertical `FMA` will now display `G/S` in green.

![PFD when G/S is activated](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-FMA-GS-active.png "PFD when G/S is activated"){loading=lazy }

We are now descending along the glideslope. The radio altimeter comes alive at 2,500ft above the ground to display the actual precise height above ground.

![Radio altimeter alive](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-radio-alt.png "Radio altimeter alive"){loading=lazy }

This concludes *Intercepting the ILS Glideslope*

---

## 3. Preparation and Checklist for Landing

**Situation:**

- Aircraft is established on ILS localizer and glideslope
- Flaps are set to 2

At this point, we would prepare the aircraft for a possible missed approach and go-around by setting the go-around altitude in the FCU (see *MISSED APPR* procedure in the charts). We skip this for this beginner guide.

To set us up for the final approach we do the following steps:

- `Gear down`: Sometime between 2,500ft and 1,500ft, typically around 5-6NM from the runway.
- Turn on `RWY TURN OFF` lights and set `NOSE` light to `T.O`.
- Set `FLAPS 3` and shortly after `FLAPS FULL` (always check speed before setting flaps. Otherwise, you might end up in an overspeed situation).
- Going `FLAPS FULL` will reduce our speed to V~app~.
- Arm `Autobrakes` (`Low` when dry, `Med` in rain or snow or a short runway).
    - If MAX manual braking is required, please see the section below - [here](#max-manual-braking-scenario).
- Arm `Speedbrake` by pulling up the `Speedbrake` lever (Speedbrake must be retracted to arm).

**We need to be fully set up and stable at 1,000ft above the ground.**

![Fully setup for landing](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Landing-Cockpit.png "Fully setup for landing"){loading=lazy}

![RWY TURN OFF ON and NOSE T.O](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Landing-lights.png "RWY TURN OFF ON and NOSE T.O"){loading=lazy }

#### Cabin Crew

In real life, the cabin crew will have been asked to prepare the cabin for landing during the descent. The exact moment and process might differ between airlines, but most seem to do this when the `Seatbelt Signs` are turned on during descent (typically at the latest at 10,000ft).

The Cabin Crew will notify the pilots either by a "Cabin Ready" button (A320neo) or by a call to the cockpit (A320ceo) once they are ready and strapped-in themselves.

In the Microsoft Flight Simulator, we simulate this by pressing the `CALLS ALL` button on the left of the overhead panel. This will set the "Cabin Ready" status as shown in the ECAM and there will be a short announcement playing "Cabin Crew take your seats for landing".

![Cabin notification](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/CALLS-all.png "Cabin notification"){loading=lazy }

Complete the **Landing Checklist**

![Landing checklist](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Landing-checklist.png "Landing checklist"){loading=lazy width=50%}

For the landing, we have our hand on the thrust levers for a potential go-around, so we can quickly push the levers forward into `TO GA`.<br/>
**We do not move the levers until the last seconds before landing.**

This concludes *Preparation and Checklist for Landing*

---

## 4. Landing

**Situation:**

- Aircraft is fully set up for landing as per previous chapters.
- Configuration is `FLAPS FULL`.
- Aircraft is at about 1000 ft above the ground.
- Wind is calm (no crosswind for this beginner guide).

Although the A320 can do an automatic landing (**Autoland**) we will do a manual landing as this is more common and also more fun.

For an advanced guide on Autoland, see [here](../advanced-guides/flight-guidance/autoland.md).

We MUST get landing clearance from ATC before we actually are allowed to land. Without landing clearance, we must do a go-around (not part of this beginner guide) before touching the runway. Usually, ATC will have given us clearance at this point. Late clearance is rare and communicated to us beforehand.

Next, we turn the **Autopilot** `OFF` at about 500 ft above the ground by pressing the `AP1` button on the `FCU`. We leave the **Autothrust** on, so we don't have to worry about thrust and speed at all (Leaving **Autothrust** on for landing is common for the Airbus).

![Cockpit view when AP has been turned off](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Cockpit-view-AP-off.png "Cockpit view when AP has been turned off"){loading=lazy}

Now look out at the PAPIs which guide us vertically down to the correct touchdown point.  We want two white lights and 2 red lights.

![PAPI indication correct path](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PAPI-2red2white.png "PAPI indication correct path"){loading=lazy}

See also [Wikipedia:PAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_approach_path_indicator)

We correct our pitch only very carefully when too high (3 - 4 white) or too low (3 - 4 red). We don't need a lot of input to the sidestick to correct.

We aim for the middle of the touchdown zone, which is marked by the touchdown zone markers.

![Runway touchdown zone](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Runway-touchdown-zone.png "Runway touchdown zone"){loading=lazy}

Also, we try to aim for the center line of the runway in a way that it points directly under us.

![Hold the runway center line pointing under us](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Hold-Runway-Centerline.png "Hold the runway center line pointing under us"){loading=lazy}

Correct your final heading and bank very carefully. We should not need to correct much at this point.

!!!info "Crosswind landings"
    Crosswind landings are beyond the scope of this beginner guide. There are many good tutorials for crosswind landings in the A320 on YouTube.

 Once over the runway threshold, we look towards the end of the runway to better judge our pitch, especially for the so-called **Flare**.

!!!info "Flare"
    The flare follows the final approach phase and precedes the touchdown and roll-out phases of landing. In the flare, the nose of the plane is raised, slowing the descent rate and therefore, creating a softer touchdown, and the proper attitude is set for touchdown. \[...\] In the case of tricycle gear-equipped aircraft, the attitude is set to touchdown on the main (rear) landing gear. (source: [Wikipedia: Landing flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_flare))

 At the runway threshold we should be about 50ft above ground and prepare to set the thrust levers to idle and flare.

 ![Runway threshold](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Runway-threshold.png "Runway threshold"){loading=lazy}

At about 30ft, we start our flare by pulling back on the sidestick carefully. We only need a few degrees in positive pitch and hold the aircraft there. Too much flare will cause the aircraft to float down the runway, too little will cause a harder landing.

At about 10-20ft, we pull back the thrust levers to idle (the aircraft also sounds the callout "retard retard ...") 
so that we are at idle thrust **before** we touch the ground.

![PFD during flare](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-Flare.png "PFD during flare"){loading=lazy }

We hold the attitude of the aircraft until it settles on the ground. **Do not push the sidestick forward (nose down) once flared.** We let the aircraft settle to the runway while holding the pitch.

**Practice this!!**

On touchdown of the main gear, the `Speed Brakes` will deploy automatically (we have armed them earlier) and we pull the thrust levers into the reverse position.

![Reverse Thrust](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Thrustlevers-Revers.png "Reverse Thrust"){loading=lazy}

We let the front gear settle gently on the runway (don't slam it down) and hold the center line of the runway while we are reducing speed. The speed reduction should be monitored on the `PFD` speed band and the speed trend arrow.

The `Autobrakes` should now have activated and started to further decelerate the aircraft. This can be checked by the `Autobrake` annunciators.

![Speed trend arrow](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/PFD-speedtrend.png "Speed trend arrow"){loading=lazy}
![Autobrake annunciator](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Autobrake-annunciator.png "Autobrake annunciator"){loading=lazy}

The upper ECAM should now show the engines in reverse mode (`REV`) and the lower ECAM shows the `Speed Brakes` (spoiler) deployed. Also, you should notice that the brakes actually get hotter.

!!! block ""

    ![ECAM showing reverser](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/ECAM-Rev.png "ECAM showing reverser"){loading=lazy align=left width=45%}

    ![ECAM showing speed brakes](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/ECAM-Spped-Vrk.png "ECAM showing speed brakes"){loading=lazy align=right width=45%}

At about 60 knots we put the thrust levers back to idle and at about 40 knots we release the `Autobrakes` by braking manually, which deactivates the `Autobrake`.

### MAX Manual Braking Scenario

In a situation, where the pilot flying has established that MAX manual braking is to be performed, the following actions are required:

- Autobrake medium must be selected.
- Reverser MAX must be selected at touchdown.
- Pilot flying will override the autobrake on nosewheel touchdown and apply maximum braking pedal deflection.

This concludes *Landing*

---

## 5. Vacate Runway

**Situation:**

- Aircraft has landed and is still on the center line of the runway.
- Speed is < 40 knots.

We look for the next runway exit and slow down to about 15 knots before we start turning off the runway.

We continue rolling forward until we passed the runway entry marker with the **full length** of our aircraft.

![Aircraft stopped after runway is vacated](../assets/beginner-guide/landing/Runway-vacated.png "Aircraft stopped after runway is vacated"){loading=lazy}

We can now safely stop the aircraft and do our "After Landing" checklist.

If ATC did not already contact us on the ground, we would contact them now to let them know we have vacated the runway. They will give us taxi instructions, so we can continue taxiing to our gate once we have completed the after landing tasks.

!!!info "After landing tasks in simulation"
    In real life, the A320 will have two pilots which can actually do things in parallel. Talking to ATC, taxiing the aircraft and doing the after landing tasks. In the simulation we are typically alone, so it is perfectly fine to stop once we have fully vacated the runway and do these things one after the other. Talking to ATC and getting taxi instruction, do the after landing tasks and checklist, taxiing to gate.

This concludes *Vacate Runway*
