Each block above (limitation block, approach procedure block, etc.) is separated by a blank line.

A condition that is included in a limitation block and the associated action line that is included in the procedure block are separated by a blank line.

Example: Illustration with the ECAM alert ENG 1(2) SHUTDOWN. In this
example, the action line “LDG DIST PROC … APPLY” applies only in the
case of severe ice accretion.
