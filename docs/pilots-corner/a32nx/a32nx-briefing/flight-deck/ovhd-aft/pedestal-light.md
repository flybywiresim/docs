## Description

### Pedestal Light

Light for the pedestal. Controlled by the potentiometer on the right side of the pedestal itself.

### Audio Switching

The third ACP can be used if ACP1 or ACP2 fail.
Doing so takes away the third occupant's access to the acoustic equipment. AUDIO 3 XFRD appears in green on the ECAM MEMO display.

If set to CAPT 3 or F/O 3 the corresponding pilot uses his acoustic equipment and the third ACP.
