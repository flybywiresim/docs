## Usage

### BLOWER and EXTRACT

- AUTO:
    - When both switches are on AUTO:
        - On the ground before TO power, the system is in open circuit configuration (or in closed configuration when the skin temperature is below the ground threshold).
        - On the ground after TO power, and in flight, the ventilation system is in closed-circuit configuration.
- OVRD:
    - When either switch is on OVRD:
        - Closed-circuit configuration.
        - Air from the a/c system is added to ventilation air.
        - The blower fan stops if the BLOWER pushbutton switch is in the OVRD position.
    - When both pushbutton switches are on OVRD:
        - Air flows from the a/c system and then overboard.
        - The extract fan continues to run.
