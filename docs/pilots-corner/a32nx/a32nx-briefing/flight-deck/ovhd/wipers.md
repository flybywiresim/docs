!!! note "API Documentation: [Wiper Panel](../../../../../aircraft/a32nx/a32nx-api/a32nx-flightdeck-api.md#wiper-panel)"

## DESCRIPTION

Each windshield is provided with two-speed electric wipers that are controlled by individual WIPER selectors. A rain repellent system is installed, but is deactivated by some airlines.

## Usage

### WIPER SELECTOR:

- OFF:
    - Wiper is stowed out of view at the base of the window.
- SLOW:
    - Wiper operates at low speed.
- FAST:
    - Wiper operates at high speed.

### RAIN RPLNT

- When the button is pushed, the timer applies a measured quantity of rain repellent to the applicable windshield. To repeat the cycle, the push button must be pushed again.
- This function is inhibited when the aircraft is on the ground and the engines are not running.
