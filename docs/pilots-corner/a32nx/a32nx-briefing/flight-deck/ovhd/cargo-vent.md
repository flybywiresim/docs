## Description

An extraction fan draws air from forward cargo or aft cargo, and exhausts it overboard. Air from the cabin replaces the exhausted air, thus ventilating the cargo compartments.

## Usage

### AFT ISOL VALVE

The switch controls the aft isolation valves and the extraction fan.

- Auto:
    - Inlet and outlet isolation valves open. The extraction fan runs if there is no smoke detected in the aft cargo bay.
- OFF:
    - Inlet and outlet isolation valves and the trim air valve close. Extraction fan stops.
- FAULT Lt:
    - Amber light and ECAM caution when inlet or outlet valve is not in the selected position.
