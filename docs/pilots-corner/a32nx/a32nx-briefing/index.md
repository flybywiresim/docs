# A320neo Pilot Briefing

This A320neo Pilot Briefing shall give a good overview of most A320neo
systems for personal flight simulation with focus on Microsoft Flight
Simulator and the FlyByWire A32NX aircraft add-on.

Other variations of the A320 (A318, A319, A321) have a lot of overlap
but are omitted in this briefing.

<p style="color:coral; font-size:24px;">This is for simulation purposes only.</p>
