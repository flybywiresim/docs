# MCDU Messages

Messages displayed on the MCDU are of two types and displayed in two colors.

- Type I : A direct result of a pilot action;
- Type II : Information about a situation, or a call for pilot action;
- Type II messages are stored in a first-in/first-out message queue (5 messages max)
- They are suppressed if correct data is entered or when they no longer apply
- The flight crew can clear all messages by pressing the CLEAR key on the MCDU console.
-  <span style="color: #ff9a00">Amber (A)</span> : Important
- White (W) : Less important
