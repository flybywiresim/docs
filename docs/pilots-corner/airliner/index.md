# Airliner and Aviation Overview 

Welcome to the Pilot's Corner "Airliner and Aviation" of the FlyByWire Documentation site.

This section of the documentation contains guides applicable to airliners and commercial aviation. The guides are 
focussing on Airbus aircraft (mainly the A320 and A380), but the principles can often be applied to other airliners as well.

These guides are tailored towards beginners and advanced users alike. Each topic may serve as a reminder of proper 
procedures at different stages of flight for veteran sim pilots.
