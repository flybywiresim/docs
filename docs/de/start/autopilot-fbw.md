# Autopilot / Fly-By-Wire

!!! warning "Important"

    * The custom autopilot system needs at least stable 17 fps to work properly. Any lower performance may result in unexpected behaviour.
    * Use modern flight model (legacy flight model is not supported)
    * It's crucial for the Autothrust system to have properly setup detents. Ensure that you have enough dead zone around the detents.
    * Typical issues when this is not done properly: constantly flashing "LVR CLB", FLX / TOGA not engaging or ATHR not holding speed correctly (the latter can also happen when in CLB/OP CLB or DES/OP DES and flying manually -> in that case you need to take care of holding speed with pitch)
    * Any mod or add-on that changes the physics or has impact on the flight model are **not supported**

***

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please take the following into account:

* read the known and typical issues to be sure it's not already known or can be solved that way
* have a look at your fps
* note down which flight condition you are (in flight, on ground)
* note down what the FMA showed (or even better: take a screenshot or make a video)
* you can press the DFDR button (right of the throttle levers and above the TCAS panel) to mark an event
* if you ask for support you might be asked for a FDR file, those can be found in the work folder (see below)

## Custom Autopilot and Autothrust System incl. new Engine model

‚ö†Ô∏è This is work in progress, there are still issues, see the [Known Issues](#known-issues)

‚ö†Ô∏è When throttle sensitivity is changed, the throttle configuration needs to be adapted in most cases.

:information_source: It is recommended that the sidestick uses a linear sensitivity with only dead zone set appropriately.

:information_source: It is recommended to use a linear sensitivity for the throttle axis.

:information_source: The throttle configuration can be adapted using the EFB.

### Typical issues and how to solve them

???+ info "FMA keeps blinking with message `LVR CLB`"

    If this is the case your throttle calibration is not properly. The values of the throttle axis range from -1.0 to 1.0 independently if you're using reverse on axis or not. When the current throttle position is larger or equal then the start position and smaller or equal than the end position of a detent, the throttles are considered to be in that detent.

    Ensure that:

    * detents are large enough defined so hardware inaccuracy is taken into account (i.e. detents on the Thrustmaster TCA are not that hard and values can quite differ even one thinks it's in the detent
    * there is enough range between the detents (meaning end position of detent and start position of next detent are at least wide as the detents)

    **Important**: if you have issues, don't look at the animation part to check if it's in the detent. Check the values in the EFB, those are relevant and not the animation.

??? info "Autothrust does not hold target speed in manual flight"

    Important rule is to always monitor the FMA. If you're in manual flight and you're in `CLB`, `OP CLB`, `DES` or `OP DES` the autothrust applies either `THR CLB` (limited by the throttle levers) or `THR IDLE`. The speed needs to be controlled by pitch and in manual flight the pilot is responsible to do so by following the flight director orders.

    If this is not your desired mode, you can do two things:

    * engage another vertical mode (i.e. V/S or FPA)
    * disengage both flight directors, this will force the Autothrust into SPEED mode

    **Reminder**: Speed is only controlled properly using thrust when Autothrust is engaged and active, thrust levers are in detent CLB, active FMA mode is `SPEED` or `MACH`.

??? info "`SRS` does not engage on take-off"

    `SRS` mode needs at least a V2 entered on TO PERF page. Additionally it does only engage when the detents are set properly. If no FLX temperature is set, this needs to be TOGA. If a FLX temperature is set, it's FLX/MCT or TOGA.

    Other conditions:

    * plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground
    * Flaps extended at least in position 1+F

??? info "`RWY` does not engage on take-off"

    There is currently no auto-tune available for the LOC on take-off. You need to enter the right frequency manually. Beside that `RWY` mode only engages with the following conditions:

    * LOC signal valid
    * LOC deviation smaller than 1/2 dot
    * Deviation between plane heading and LOC bearing is < 20¬∞
    * Plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground
    * Flaps extended at least in position 1+F

??? info "`LVR CLB` flashes immediately after lift-off"

    Ensure that both thrust reduction and acceleration altitude on TO PERF page are properly setup.

??? info "`LAND` mode does not engage"

    Before reaching 400 ft radio altitude the FMA needs to show `LOC` and `G/S`. If one of them is still in capture mode (`LOC*` or `G/S*`) you need to perform a go around maneuver or land manually, LAND will not engage that way.

??? info "Autoland does not perform as expected"

    The Autoland system is quite complex and is dependent on multiple environmental conditions to work properly, such as:

    * LOC accuracy in terms of
      * alignment of heading to runway heading
      * alignment on runway centerline
      * availability down to 0 ft and also during roll-out
    * G/S accuracy in terms of
      * alignment to correct height (50 ft over runway threshold)
      * availability down to 50 ft
    * ground in front of runway threshold needs to be more or less stable (no fast raising terrain) beginning 200 ft radio altitude

    **Reminder:** If the autoland warning light goes on it's IRL procedure to go around!

    Unfortunately a lot of runways (either using Navigraph or not) have issues for LOC and/or G/S, either in terms of alignment or availability. On many runways you loose the LOC during `ROLL OUT`. In that case the roll out has to be performed manually by disengaging the AP.

??? info "Flight controls are not working after reload of the sim or airplane"

    Ensure that no `SimConnect.cfg` is in the Documents folder of your user profile. An older version of Kinetic Assistant installed that file and it's causing issues with SimConnect connection between our custom systems and the sim. 

??? info "Autopilot is oscillating on approach or in flight"

    Ensure that you get enough frames per second (see on top).

??? info "Climb performance is not satisfying or plane drops or increases nose heavily on approach"

    Ensure that you're using modern flight model (Options -> General -> Flight Model). Beside that also ensure that you don't have any mods or add-ons installed that have influence on the flight model or other physics.

??? info "Autopilot oscillates when using time compression"

    Time compression is not fully supported yet, this applies also to fuel burn (time compression is not taken into account).

    The reason why it can work for some and not for others is how time compression is working. For example when using time compression of 2x for the custom systems it's like having 1/2 of your displayed fps, when you're using 4x it's like 1/4 of it. So taking into account the 17 fps requirement it means you need ~ 30 fps and ~ 45 fps for 4x to work somehow, at least for smooth cruise.

    When you encounter heavy turbulence it might be needed that time compression is reduced.

    For the time being we do not recommend using it.

??? info "Ailerons are not working when using the keyboard"

    There is currently an issue with the associated events and there is currently no way to solve it.

    We highly recommend using a controller with an axis assigned to use the plane.
    
    A possible workaround is by using a tool like FSUIPC. Assign the correct events to the keys you want to use. The events that work are (mind the 's' behind aileron):
    
    * AILERONS_LEFT
    * AILERONS_RIGHT

### Mapping of events to control autopilot / autothrust

‚ö†Ô∏è Not all events are working and it's also difficult to map all default events because there is no 100% match.

The recommendation is to use a combination of default events and the custom events to trigger the FCU. This has been tested with the Honeycomb Bravo Throttle using SPAD.next or FSUIPC.

:information_source: An event file is required for FSUIPC. This needs to be placed in the FSUIPC folder beside the ini-file to be recognized. Then you can select those custom events for button press (for FS Control).

:information_source: A profile xml is required for SPAD.neXt. This needs to be placed in your configured SPAD.neXt profile folder. Then you can create a new profile based on that or by editing the XML files you can take-over the custom events in your existing profile.

You can grab the required files with the links below.
