# FBW Installer

The FlyByWire Installer is a tool that allows you to install and update the FlyByWire aircraft and its dependencies such as SimBridge. It is a standalone application that is 
separate from the aircraft itself.

## 3rd Party Aircraft and Tools

Specific 3rd party aircraft and tools we have collaborated with are also available in the installer. These are not developed by FlyByWire, but we have worked with the 
developers in various capacities in the spirit of open source collaboration. You can find a list below:
