# FlyByWire Development Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our Development Guide for the FlyByWire A32NX guide.

FlyByWire Simulations aims to maintain professional standards as well as industry-wide best practices in order to maximize developer productivity and deliver high-quality, tested products.

This is why we adopt a set of rules and practices that create a strong framework, not only around the usage of git but also surrounding code quality.

Therefore, every change or addition to the code of our aircraft goes through a multi-step development and quality assurance process.

This documentation describes the FlyByWire Development Process and tools in detail to help you set up your development environment to be able to efficiently contribute to the A32NX project.

It is structured in a series of sections which are based on each other starting with the necessary software and tools, downloading and compiling the A32NX successfully to guidelines how to contribute within the project.
