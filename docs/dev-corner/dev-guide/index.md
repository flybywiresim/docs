# FlyByWire Development Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our Development Guide for FlyByWire projects.

FlyByWire Simulations aims to maintain professional standards as well as industry-wide best practices in order to 
maximize developer productivity and deliver high-quality, tested products.

This is why we adopt a set of rules and practices that create a strong framework, not only around the usage of git 
but also surrounding code quality.

Therefore, every change or addition to the code of our aircraft goes through a multistep development and quality 
assurance process.

This documentation describes the FlyByWire Development Process and tools in detail to help you set up your 
development environment to be able to efficiently contribute to our projects.

!!! info "Structure"
    Currently these sections are specific to the A32NX. It details with the necessary software and tools, downloading and compiling the A32NX successfully, as well as guidelines on how to contribute within the project. 

    We will adapt our documentation to cover A380X development requirements in the future as well.
