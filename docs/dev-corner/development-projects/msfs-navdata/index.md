# Overview
[MSFS-Navdata](https://github.com/flybywiresim/msfs-navdata) is a package that normalises the access of navdata in MSFS by loading default navdata and parsing it to a common format.

The client is also capable of loading external data through a local server. This allows developers to build their FMS using a common format which is compatible with multiple different sources.
