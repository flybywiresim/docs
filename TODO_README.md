# How

- avoid screenshots for now - use placeholders instead (exception is flight-deck overview)   
  - text, dummy-image or similar A32NX images
- do not add notes to features if available or not. These will still change a lot and we will do it 
  shortly before release
- otherwise use the A32NX docs as a guide for the content - if you think you can improve on the pages 
  in the A32NX docs, feel free to do so for the A380X docs. But we recommend to not make your life 
  unnecessarily difficult

# TODO

1. Navigation restructuring for multiple aircraft
2. Content restructuring for common content for both aircraft
3. Create scaffolding navigation for new aircraft sections
4. Create scaffolding content for new aircraft sections
5. Content creation for new aircraft sections in roughly this priority order:
   1. Beginner Guide 
   2. Update common pages to refer to both projects and aircraft 
      - (e.g. homepage, Overview pages, FAQ, Support Guide, release notes, common questions, Install Guide, etc.)
   3. Common Features (depending on structure) - e.g. EFB, Tiller, and such...)
   4. List will be updated as needed
6. Apply new CSS style to all existing pages


## List of pages/section that need to be migrated from the A32NX docs or completed in general
Changes have been made to this list to better reflect meeting alignment with core team and A380 team. The lists below are "MUST HAVES" before we move forward with a release pipeline (at least on the docs side of things). It will be structured as follows:

- P1 - High Priority (for RC and general public)
  - Requires assistance from dev, pilot insight, and general collaboration to get out the door.
- P2 - Ongoing work
  - As aircraft develops this can be done in tandem or shortly after RC and general release.
- Docs Team - Manadatory for docs team to complete before RC and general release.
  - Clean up and docs structure that will be handled by Docs Maintainers. Contributors can focus on content.

Let's try and avoid duplication where possible.
