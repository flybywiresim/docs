## Directory Structure Overview

Appropriate documentation should fall under the following main directories:

- `pilots-corner`: Aimed at sim pilots of all levels and covers topics regarding flying an airliner and especially the Airbus A320neo.
- `dev-corner`: Dedicated to the development aspects of the A32NX add-on. It is aimed at developers, contributors or anyone who would like to start contributing to the project.

Note: Please be aware that sub-directories are present in the parent directories mentioned above. The final location of any new documentation may be altered by a maintainer.
